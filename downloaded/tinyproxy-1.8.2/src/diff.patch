+		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
+		       Version 2, June 1991
+
+ Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
+ 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
+ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
+ of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
+
+			    Preamble
+
+  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
+freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
+License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
+software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
+General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
+Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
+using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
+the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
+your programs, too.
+
+  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
+price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
+have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
+this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
+if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
+in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
+
+  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
+anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
+These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
+distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
+
+  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
+gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
+you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
+source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
+rights.
+
+  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
+(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
+distribute and/or modify the software.
+
+  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
+that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
+software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
+want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
+that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
+authors' reputations.
+
+  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
+patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
+program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
+program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
+patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
+
+  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
+modification follow.
+
+		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
+   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
+
+  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
+a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
+under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
+refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
+means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
+that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
+either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
+language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
+the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
+
+Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
+covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
+running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
+is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
+Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
+Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
+
+  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
+source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
+conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
+copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
+notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
+and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
+along with the Program.
+
+You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
+you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
+
+  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
+of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
+distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
+above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
+
+    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
+    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
+
+    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
+    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
+    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
+    parties under the terms of this License.
+
+    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
+    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
+    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
+    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
+    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
+    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
+    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
+    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
+    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
+    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
+
+These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
+identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
+and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
+themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
+sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
+distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
+on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
+this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
+entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
+
+Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
+your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
+exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
+collective works based on the Program.
+
+In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
+with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
+a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
+the scope of this License.
+
+  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
+under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
+Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
+
+    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
+    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
+    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
+
+    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
+    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
+    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
+    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
+    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
+    customarily used for software interchange; or,
+
+    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
+    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
+    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
+    received the program in object code or executable form with such
+    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
+
+The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
+making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
+code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
+associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
+control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
+special exception, the source code distributed need not include
+anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
+form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
+operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
+itself accompanies the executable.
+
+If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
+access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
+access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
+distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
+compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
+
+  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
+except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
+otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
+void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
+However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
+this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
+parties remain in full compliance.
+
+  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
+signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
+distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
+prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
+modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
+Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
+all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
+the Program or works based on it.
+
+  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
+Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
+original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
+these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
+restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
+You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
+this License.
+
+  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
+infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
+conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
+otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
+excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
+distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
+License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
+may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
+license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
+all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
+the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
+refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
+
+If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
+any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
+apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
+circumstances.
+
+It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
+patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
+such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
+integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
+implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
+generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
+through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
+system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
+to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
+impose that choice.
+
+This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
+be a consequence of the rest of this License.
+
+  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
+certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
+original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
+may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
+those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
+countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
+the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
+
+  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
+of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
+be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
+address new problems or concerns.
+
+Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
+specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
+later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
+either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
+Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
+this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
+Foundation.
+
+  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
+programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
+to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
+Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
+make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
+of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
+of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
+
+			    NO WARRANTY
+
+  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
+FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
+OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
+PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
+OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
+MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
+TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
+PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
+REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
+
+  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
+WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
+REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
+INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
+OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
+TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
+YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
+PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
+POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
+
+		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
+
+	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
+
+  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
+possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
+free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
+
+  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
+to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
+convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
+the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
+
+    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
+    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
+
+    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
+    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
+    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
+    (at your option) any later version.
+
+    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
+    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
+    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
+    GNU General Public License for more details.
+
+    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
+    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
+    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.
+
+Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
+
+If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
+when it starts in an interactive mode:
+
+    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
+    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
+    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
+    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
+
+The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
+parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
+be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
+mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
+
+You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
+school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
+necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
+
+  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
+  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
+
+  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
+  Ty Coon, President of Vice
+
+This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
+proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
+consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
+library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
+Public License instead of this License.

+
+2003-10-17  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/filter.c, ChangeLog, Makefile.am, configure.ac:

+	and the HTML installation script.)
+
+2003-10-17  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	Released tinyproxy 1.6.2 (2003-10-17)
+
+	* Makefile.am:
+	Removed a redundant "mkdir" command, since the $(mkinstalldirs)
+	command handles it correctly.
+
+2003-10-16  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/filter.c (filter_init):
+	Fixed up the comment handling code.  Closes bug 822226
+	[https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=822226&group_id=2632&atid=102632]
+
+2003-08-06  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	Released tinyproxy 1.6.1 (2003-08-06)
+
+	* heap.c (debugging_realloc):
+	Remove the assert on the ptr being NULL since a NULL pointer is
+	allowed by the realloc() spec.
+	
+	* child.c (child_main):
+	Fixed an off-by-one error with the maxrequestsperchild
+	variable.  [Fix proposed by Yannick Koehler]
+
+2003-07-14  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	Released tinyproxy 1.6.0 (2003-07-14)
+
+	* src/htmlerror.c (indicate_http_error):
+	Added calls to va_end() before leaving the function.
+
+2003-06-26  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/reqs.c (upstream_add):
+	Rewrote the function to actually handle the various types of
+	upstream configurations correctly.  Hopefully, the code is also a
+	little clearer in it's implementation.
+	
+	* src/scanner.l:
+	Modified the patterns to allow the new upstream directives to work
+	as defined in the tinyproxy.conf documentation.
+
+	* src/heap.c (debugging_free):
+	Rather than assert on a NULL pointer, log the NULL pointer and
+	return.
+
+2003-06-25  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/common.h:
+	Added a test to define INADDR_NONE if it's not present.  For
+	example, SunOS (solaris 2.8) does not include this define.  [Thank
+	to Ben Hartshorne for pointing this out.]
+
+	* doc/report.sh.tmpl:
+	Changed the calls to "ps" and "grep" to use a more portable
+	syntax.
+
+2003-06-20  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* doc/tinyproxy.conf, src/grammar.y, src/reqs.c, src/scanner.l, src/tinyproxy.h:
+	Removed the "ViaHeader" directive and replaced it with the
+	"ViaProxyName" directive.  The "Via" HTTP header is _required_ by
+	the HTTP spec, so the code has been changed to always send the
+	header.  However, including the proxy's host name could be
+	considered a security threat, so the "ViaProxyName" directive is
+	used to set the token sent in the "Via" header.  If the directive
+	is not enabled the proxy's host name will be used.
+
+2003-06-06  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/reqs.c (connect_to_upstream):
+	Fixed an off-by-one error in the snprintf() call used to build the
+	URL for the upstream proxy. [Patch suggested by David T. Pierso]
+
+2003-06-02  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* configure.ac:
+	Remove the -O2 optimization if debugging is enabled.  Also, remove
+	the -g option if the code does _not_ have debugging enabled.
+
+	* doc/tinyproxy.conf:
+	Included additional examples of how to configure the upstream
+	proxy support for more selective proxying.
+
+	* src/reqs.c, src/tinyproxy.h: (upstream_get):
+	(upstream_add): Added support to allow ip addresses and networks
+	to be used when matching an upstream proxy directive.
+	[Code by Peter da Silva]
+
+2003-05-31  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/heap.h:
+	Changed the safefree() macro to make it safe to use a conditional
+	statement, and also safe to use with a rvalue that has a side
+	effect.  [Bug fix recommended by Peter da Silva]
+
+2003-05-30  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/vector.c, src/vector.h (vector_getentry):
+	Changed the API to return the data pointer and have the length
+	returned in a argument variable pointer.  This should be a more
+	natural way of using the function.
+
+2003-05-29  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/vector.c, src/vector.h (vector_append):
+	Renamed the vector_insert() function to more accurately indicate
+	that entries are appended to the end of the vector.
+
+	* doc/tinyproxy.conf, src/grammar.y, src/reqs.c, src/reqs.h, src/tinyproxy.h:
+	Improved the upstream proxy support by making the upstream proxy
+	server configurable based on the destination host.  [Code written by
+	Peter da Silva]
+
+2003-05-10  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* Makefile.am:
+	Added support for installing the HTML error files used by tinyproxy.
+
+2003-05-05  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/reqs.c (establish_http_connection):
+	If the port being requested is not a standard HTTP port (80 or
+	443) append the port string to the host header; otherwise, leave
+	the host string with only the host's domain name.
+
+	Replaced all occurrences of constant 80 and 443 with defines
+	HTTP_PORT and HTTP_PORT_SSL.
+
+2003-05-04  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/conns.c, src/conns.h:
+	Fixed a bug that would kill a child process because of an invalid
+	safefree() call.  Basically, destroy_conn() was trying to free
+	memory not allocated by malloc.  [Fix by David T. Pierson]
+
+2003-04-16  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/reqs.c (build_url):
+	Rebuild the URL from the component pieces.  This function
+	is used by the transparent proxy code.  [Anatole Shaw]
+	(process_request): Fixed up the transparent proxy code so that
+	filtering can be done on the whole URL.  [Anatole Shaw]
+
+	(pull_client_data): Added a bug fix for Internet Explorer (IE).
+	IE will leave an extra CR and LF after the data in an HTTP POST.
+	The new code will eat the extra bytes if they're present.  Thanks
+	to Yannick Koehler for finding the bug and offering an explanation
+	as to why it was happening.
+
+	Changed all calls of connptr->remote_content_length to
+	connptr->content_length.server
+
+	* src/conns.c, src/conns.h:
+	Removed the remote_content_length field in the "conn" structure
+	and replaced it with a smaller structure containing both the
+	remote/server and the local/client content-length fields if
+	they're present in the HTTP response headers.
+
+2003-04-01  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* configure.ac:
+	Reorganized some of the code, and remove some function tests for
+	which results were never used, and removed duplicate header tests.
+
+	* src/htmlerror.c (add_error_variable):
+	Test whether connptr->error_variable is NULL, and if so call
+	safemalloc().  This is needed since saferealloc() will assert() if
+	the first argument is a NULL pointer.
+
+2003-03-26  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/reqs.c (establish_http_connection):
+	Always include the port number for the requested server.  This
+	fixes a problem when the server is not listening on the default
+	port, 80.  [Fix suggested by duncan@sapio.co.uk]
+
+2003-03-17  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* doc/Makefile.am:
+	Create the doc/report.sh script from the new template file.
+
+	* doc/report.sh, doc/report.sh.tmpl:
+	Moved the doc/report.sh script to doc/report.sh.tmpl file.  The
+	script is then updated by the make procedure to reflect the
+	correct location of the tinyproxy executable.
+
+2003-03-14  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/htmlerror.c:
+	Made get_html_file() and lookup_variable() static functions since
+	they are only used with this file.
+
+	* src/utils.c (send_http_message):
+	Changed the function to use the new http_message API.
+
+2003-03-13  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/grammar.y, src/scanner.l:
+	Allow the URL for the statistic page to be controlled from the
+	configuration file, rather than being hard-coded in the program.
+	[John M Wright]
+
+	* doc/tinyproxy.conf:
+	Include example information for the new "file" directives
+	(ErrorFile, DefaultErrorFile, StatFile.)  [Steven Young]
+
+	* src/utils.c, src/utils.h:
+	Moved the send_http_error_message() and indicate_http_error()
+	functions into the htmlerror.c file, and recoded them to use the
+	new variable substitution system. [Steven Young]
+
+	* src/common.h:
+	Fixed up the include order for the <sys/time.h> and <time.h>
+	headers.
+
+	* src/http_message.c, src/http_message.h:
+	An API to handle HTTP messages as concrete entities.
+
+	* src/text.c, src/text.h (chomp):
+	Fixed up the code to prevent negative array access.  Added
+	code to make sure the supplied arguments are valid.
+
+2003-03-09  Steven Young  <sdyoung@well.com>
+
+	* src/htmlerror.[ch]: Code to allow the use of substituted
+	variables in .html files for error reporting instead of
+	hard-coded HTML documents that use snprintf() for variable
+	substitution.
+
+	* src/stats.c: Changed showstats to use the HTML variable
+	functions when possible.  It still retains the hard-coded
+	page for when an HTML file is not available.
+
+	* src/reqs.c: Changed calls to indicate_http_error() to
+	use the new HTML variable mechanism.
+
+	* src/tinyproxy.h: Added variables to config structure
+	to keep track of the files to be displayed for various
+	HTTP errors and the stats page.
+
+	* src/conns.h: Added variables to keep track of the
+	variables to be substituted in .html files displayed
+	to that client.
+
+	* src/grammar.y, src/scanner.l: Added parser support
+	for the error file configuration keywords 
+	(ErrorFile, DefaultErrorFile, StatFile)
+
+2003-03-08  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	Released tinyproxy 1.5.3 (2003-03-10)
+
+	Added the files required for creating tinyproxy RPMs for Redhat based
+	systems. (See packaging/redhat)
+
+2003-02-26  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/tinyproxy.c (main):
+	Removed duplicate code calling the filter_destroy() function.
+	Once is enough.  [Detected by John M Wright]
+
+2003-01-27  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/tinyproxy.c (display_usage):
+	Removed the output line mentioning that regular expression support
+	was included.  It will be there always.
+
+	* src/reqs.c (connect_to_upstream):
+	Reorganized the preprocessor directives to make sure the
+	function's symbol name is stored, even if upstream was not
+	compiled it.  This should keep some compilers from reporting
+	errors.
+
+	* doc/tinyproxy.conf, src/filter.c, src/grammar.y, src/scanner.l,
+	* src/tinyproxy.h:
+	Added support for conditionally using case sensitive filtering
+	files.  Code changes from James E. Flemer.
+
+	* configure.ac:
+	Moved the AH_TEMPLATE() macro for the GNU regex library to out
+	from inside an if...fi test.  Thanks to James E. Flemer for
+	supplying a patch.
+
+	Bumped up the version number.
+
+	* doc/tinyproxy.8:
+	Changed the default manual section to section 8 (administrator
+	commands).
+
+	* src/reqs.c (process_client_headers):
+	Fixed inverted anonymous header logic.  Fix comes from the FreeBSD
+	port through James E. Flemer.
+
+2003-01-22  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	Released tinyproxy 1.5.2 (2003-01-22)
+
+2002-12-04  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/reqs.c (strip_username_password): New function to remove any
+	username/password part from the host URI.
+
+	(extract_http_url), (extract_ssl_url): Use the new
+	strip_username_password function to remove any non-host
+	information from the URI.
+
+	* src/tinyproxy.c, src/tinyproxy.h, src/utils.c, src/utils.h,
+	* src/common.h, src/conns.h, src/reqs.c:
+	Removed the "bool_t" type since it conflicts with the newer C
+	standards.  The type was just replaced by "unsigned int" types.
+
+2002-11-29  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/reqs.c (extract_http_url):
+	Removed the leading "http://" from all the tests, since it's
+	skipped by the caller before the URL is passed to this function.
+
+	(process_request): Include code to handle proxy FTP requests as
+	well.  This also lead to a bit of a cleanup in the calling
+	conventions of extract_http_url function.  tinyproxy can handle
+	both types of resources by skipping the leading :// part.
+
+2002-11-26  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* doc/tinyproxy.conf, src/grammar.y, src/reqs.c, src/scanner.l,
+	* src/tinyproxy.h:
+	Included code to disable the sending of the Via header.  This is
+	now controlled by the ViaHeader configure directive.
+
+2002-11-21  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/child.c (child_main):
+	Cleaned up the notice string to be more clear why a child is being
+	closed.
+
+	* src/tinyproxy.c (main):
+	Check to see if the PID file was created successfully, and if not
+	report this to the user and close the program.
+
+	* src/utils.c (create_file_safely):
+	Rather than exiting the program if there is an error, a negative
+	"error code" is returned to the program.  The various callers then
+	need to decide what to do.
+
+	(pidfile_create): Returns an error status depending on whether the
+	PID file was created successfully.
+
+2002-11-13  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/reqs.c (relay_connection):
+	Shutdown the client socket for writing once all the data has been
+	sent.
+
+	* src/conns.c (destroy_conn):
+	Added code to log any error messages when the sockets are closed.
+
+2002-11-05  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* doc/tinyproxy.conf:
+	Removed the example for the Tunnel directive since it's been removed.
+
+2002-11-03  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* configure.ac, src/grammar.y, src/reqs.c, src/scanner.l,
+	src/tinyproxy.c, src/tinyproxy.h:
+	
+	Removed all the code supporting the TCP tunnelling feature of
+	tinyproxy.  There is really no need for this code, since there are
+	perfectly good programs out there (like rinetd) which are designed for
+	TCP tunnelling.  tinyproxy should be a good HTTP proxy, nothing more,
+	and nothing less; therefore, the tunnelling code is gone.
+
+2002-10-17  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/reqs.c (relay_connection):
+	Ivan pointed out a bug with the code to send any
+	remaining data to the server when the connections are being closed.
+	It was a one line fix.
+
+2002-10-03  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/tinyproxy.c:
+	Fixed up the storing and sending of the internal tinyproxy logs prior
+	to when the log file is created.  Also, the log file is created with
+	the proper owner permissions.
+
+	* src/log.c, src/log.h:
+	The internal log structure now uses a vector rather than a hash.  This
+	change was required to actually display all the logs in the correct
+	order.  Also, all log lines are stored internally while tinyproxy is
+	starting.  At the appropriate point all the logs are written to the
+	log file.
+
+	* src/filter.c: Filtering is now case insensitive.
+
+	* src/child.c (child_main):
+	Check to make sure memory could be allocated to handle
+	the child request.
+	(child_main_loop): Added a call to truncate_log_file() when the log
+	file is to be rotated.
+
+2002-08-09  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	Released tinyproxy 1.5.1 (2002-08-09)
+
+2002-07-09  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/utils.c: (create_file_safely):
+	(pidfile_create): Changed all the error logging to write to
+	standard error and then exit the program.  This will prevent
+	segmentation fault problems from occurring because the log file
+	could not be created properly.
+
+	* src/heap.c (malloc_shared_memory):
+	Changed the static character array to include the ".XXXXXX" string
+	already.  This saves one system call when creating a temporary
+	file name.
+
+2002-07-08  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* README:
+	Updated the "Support" section to include a link to the tinyproxy
+	Bug Tracker system hosted by SourceForge.
+
+2002-07-05  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* configure.ac:
+	Removed the -D_REENTRANT C flag since tinyproxy is no longer a
+	multi-threaded program.
+
+2002-06-27  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/child.c (child_make):
+	Reset the various signals to the default signal handler so that
+	the children can be properly destroyed.
+
+2002-06-15  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/log.c (log_message):
+	Changed the code so that the log is opened, written, and closed
+	whenever a message is submitted.  This allows the log file to be
+	moved away, for example a rotating the log, and yet still have the
+	information written to the correct file name by all the children.
+
+	* src/tinyproxy.c:
+	Renamed the "log_rotation_request" boolean to "received_sighup".
+	(main): Removed the log file creation code because it has been
+	moved into the log.c file.  Also, removed the explicit fclose()
+	for the log file since it will be close when the program has
+	exited.
+
+	* src/child.c (child_main_loop):
+	Moved the filter re-initiation code into the loop.  This code is
+	activated whenever the SIGHUP signal is received.
+
+	* src/tinyproxy.h:
+	Removed the "logf" FILE structure from the config structure, and
+	also renamed the "log_rotation_request" boolean to
+	"received_sighup".
+
+	* src/utils.c, src/utils.h:
+	Removed the rotate_log_files() function since I'm moving to an
+	Apache style where the _user_ needs to move the log file
+	themselves, and tinyproxy will continue to write to the original
+	name.  This allows more flexibility for users to determine their
+	own log rotation scheme.
+
+2002-06-07  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/filter.c, src/filter.h:
+	Added code to handle the "FilterDefaultDeny" directive.  The
+	filter_set_default_policy() function is used to select the default
+	policy (either default allow or default deny) for the filtering
+	code.  Also, the two filtering functions now support the policy
+	code.
+
+	* doc/tinyproxy.conf, src/grammar.y, src/scanner.l:
+	Added the "FilterDefaultDeny" directive to allow the user to
+	select whether the default policy of the filter is to allow
+	everything which isn't denied, or to deny everything which isn't
+	allowed.
+
+2002-06-06  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/reqs.c:
+	A bunch of changes from Petr Lampa that add transparent proxy
+	support to tinyproxy.  The additional code is in
+	process_request(), but Petr also had to change around some of the
+	other functions (like process_client_headers and
+	handle_connection.)  Note: Right now this code has not been
+	tested, but it is believed to work.  To enable run ./configure
+	--enable-transparent-proxy
+
+	* src/filter.c (filter_domain):
+	Removed code which stripped of a port number from the host name.
+	The "host" variable will _always_ be just the name by the time
+	filter_domain() is called.
+
+	* src/tinyproxy.c (display_usage):
+	Added a message indicating whether transparent proxy support has
+	been compiled in.
+
+	* configure.ac:
+	Added the "--enable-transparent-proxy" flag and moved the
+	AH_TEMPLATE() macros to _outside_ the "if" tests.
+
+	* src/grammar.y:
+	Added a warning message to the Bind directive stating that it will
+	be ignored if "transparent proxy" has been compiled into
+	tinyproxy.
+
+	* src/log.c (send_stored_logs):
+	Actually included the code to output the stored logs.  Plus, there
+	was a bug with how I was calling the hashmap_is_end() function.
+	This has now been fixed.
+
+2002-06-05  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* doc/Makefile.am:
+	Added the "filter-howto.txt" file to the distribution.
+
+	* doc/filter-howto.txt:
+	Added a short filtering HOWTO document from Patrick L. McGillan.
+
+	* src/child.c (child_main):
+	Added a DEBUG call to let me know which process has accepted a
+	connection.  This is needed for debugging using "gdb".
+
+	* src/heap.c (malloc_shared_memory):
+	Removed the assert() call for shared_file since it's now a static
+	variable.
+
+	* src/acl.c (acl_string_processing):
+	Moved the string processing code out of check_acl() and into it's
+	own function because it now does two (2) tests.  If the ACL string
+	is a complete host name, in other words doesn't start with a
+	period, than a reverse DNS look-up is done on the host name and
+	compared to the IP address of the client; otherwise, the normal
+	text string comparison is done.
+	(check_acl): Moved the string text out of the function and removed
+	some logging code by jumping to the "Deny" code at the end of the
+	function.
+
+2002-05-31  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/utils.c (create_file_safely):
+	Added the "truncate_file" boolean flag.  This is needed since I
+	use this function for both the log file and the pid file, and they
+	behave differently when tinyproxy is started.
+	(pidfile_create): Call create_file_safely() with a TRUE
+	"truncate_file" flag so that the file is emptied whenever the pid
+	file is needed.
+
+	* src/tinyproxy.c:
+	The log file is now opened in "append" mode so that you can
+	restart tinyproxy without losing the log file.
+
+	* src/reqs.c (process_server_headers):
+	Since we're stripping off the carriage return and newline, we need
+	to add them back on when sending the response header to the
+	client.
+
+	* src/sock.c (getpeer_information):
+	Fixed a problem retrieving the FQDN of a host because I was
+	passing in an incorrect parameter to gethostbyaddr().  D'oh.
+
+2002-05-29  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/heap.c (malloc_shared_memory):
+	Removed the MMAP_ANON and open("/dev/zero") since they are not
+	portable across a while enough spectrum of machines.  Right now
+	tinyproxy is using a "classic" temporary file method of sharing
+	memory.  This will likely be improved in the future.
+
+	* src/child.c, src/stats.c:
+	Changed the tests on the return value from malloc_shared_memory()
+	to make tinyproxy more portable, since we can't be certain that
+	"if (!ret_value)" would actually detect a mmap() error.
+
+	* src/reqs.c (add_header_to_connection):
+	Removed the "double_cgi" boolean, since tinyproxy now ignores all
+	the headers after a "double CGI" situation has occurred.
+	(get_all_headers): Instead of dropping duplicate headers when the
+	"double CGI" situation occurs, tinyproxy will now drop _all_ the
+	headers from the "inner" HTTP response.
+
+	* src/stats.c (init_stats):
+	Fixed a spelling mistake where the number of bytes being allocated
+	was incorrect.
+
+2002-05-28  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/reqs.c (add_header_to_connection):
+	Added a boolean to indicate that a "Double CGI" situation is in
+	affect.  This is needed to solve a problem with some sites (like
+	cgi.ebay.com) where they are sending two HTTP response lines (and
+	associated headers) with a response.
+	(get_all_headers): Detect if a "Double CGI" situation has occurred.
+
+	* src/reqs.c (get_all_headers):
+	Added code to ignore a "response" line in a header.  This was
+	pointed out as being a problem with eBay (cgi.ebay.com)
+	(process_server_headers): Added code to make skip blank lines
+	before a response line.
+
+2002-05-27  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* doc/Makefile.am:
+	Fixed up a problem where the tinyproxy manual page was not getting
+	included with the distribution.
+
+	* src/reqs.c (process_request):
+	Changed the filtering code around to handle both domains and URLs.
+
+	* src/tinyproxy.h:
+	Added into the config structure the filter_urls and
+	filter_extended flags.
+
+	* src/tinyproxy.c: Some spelling fixes.
+
+	* src/sock.c (opensock):
+	Changed a comment around to better state what the code is actually
+	doing.
+
+	* src/filter.c, src/filter.h:
+	Added a copyright for James E. Flemer since these are his changes.
+	(filter_init): Added code to handle both host and URLs.  Also
+	include code to use extended regular expressions.
+	(filter_domain): The old filter_url function has been renamed
+	filter_domain().
+	(filter_url): This function now actually filters complete URLs.
+
+	* doc/tinyproxy.conf, src/grammar.y, src/scanner.l:
+	Added support for the "FilterURLs" and "FilterExtended" directives.
+	These directives were submitted by James Flemer for use with the new
+	filtering code.
+
+	* configure.ac: Updated the version number (pre 1)
+
+	* src/tinyproxy.c (display_license): Updated the copyright dates
+	(main): Moved the signals around so that the appropriate signal is
+	assigned to either the children or just the parrent process.
+	Updated the copyright on the file.
+
+2002-05-26  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* doc/tinyproxy.conf: Removed the "DNSserver" directives since
+	they're no longer needed.
+
+	* configure.ac: Removed the pthread related tests and added a test
+	for the sys/mman.h header (needed for shared memory.)
+
+	* src/Makefile.am: Removed the "dnsserver" program all together,
+	and changed the names of some of the files.
+
+	* src/heap.c, src/heap.h: Added the malloc_shared_memory() and
+	calloc_shared_memory() function to allow the use of shared memory
+	between all the children.
+
+	* src/log.h, src/reqs.c: Spelling changes (from thread to child.)
+
+	* src/grammar.y, src/scanner.l: Removed the directives for the old
+	DNSserver process.
+
+	* src/stats.c: The stats structure has been moved into a shared
+	memory block since it needs to be shared by all the children.
+
+	* src/tinyproxy.c: Removed all the code relating to the DNS API as
+	it's no longer needed with the new pre-forked model.
+	
+	Updated the copyright dates.
+	
+	(main): Moved the signals around so that they are assigned to the
+	appropriate process level: either the parent only, or all
+	processes.
+
+	* src/sock.c: Removed the DNS API calls and replaced them with the
+	standard gethostbyname() and gethostbyaddr() functions.  This is
+	possible because tinyproxy now uses a standard pre-forked() method.
+
+	* src/common.h: Removed the "pthread" related includes.
+
+	* src/thread.c, src/thread.h: No longer using a threading model;
+	so these files have been replaced by the child.c/child.h files, 
+	which use a pre-forked model.
+
+	* src/dnsclient.h, src/dnsserver.c, src/dnsclient.c: I didn't like
+	the DNS co-process design so I changed tinyproxy from a threading
+	model to a standard pre-forked model.  This means I don't need the
+	DNS co-process files.  Gone.
+
+	* src/child.c, src/child.h: Changed from using a threading model
+	to a standard pre-forked model.  Therefore the thread.c file has
+	been removed and this file replaces it.  These files are really
+	just the thread.c and thread.h files with all the threading stuff
+	replaced with fork() code.  Most of the code is identical.
+
+2002-05-24  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/buffer.c, src/conns.c, src/dnsclient.c, src/hashmap.c,
+	  src/reqs.c, src/stats.c, src/text.c, src/thread.c,
+	  src/tinyproxy.c, src/utils.c, src/vector.c: Fixed a tonne of
+	spelling mistakes.
+
+	* src/sock.c: Fixed some spelling mistakes, and removed the
+	getpeer_ip() and getpeer_string() functions as they've been
+	replaced by the getpeer_information() function.
+
+2002-05-23  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/dnsserver.c: The DNS resolver for use by the various
+	tinyproxy threads.  The DNS resolver was moved into a separate
+	function to prevent the blocking problem the 1.4.x and 1.5.0
+	versions experienced when a DNS query would take a long time to
+	return.  While the query was blocking, other threads could not
+	establish their own queries, so they all blocked.  Not so good.
+
+	* src/dnsclient.c: Introduce the new "dnsserver" API.  These
+	functions are the client side access points.
+
+	* src/utils.c: Moved most of the code into separate files.  The
+	debugging heap related code is now in heap.c; the text string code
+	is in text.c; and, the daemon related code is in daemon.c.
+
+	* src/tinyproxy.h: Moved all the system header include code into
+	the "common.h" file.
+
+	* src/tinyproxy.c (takesig): Added a signal handler for the
+	SIGCHLD signals since a child process is spawned to handle the
+	"dnsserver" process.
+	(main): Added code to start and stop the "dnsserver" process.
+	Switched the signal setup function to the new portable
+	set_signal_handler() function.  Include a test to make sure the
+	two "dnsserver" directives are set.
+
+	* src/sock.c (lookup_domain): Rewrote the function to use the new
+	"dnsserver" API.  This removes the need for the pthread mutex.
+	(getpeer_information): Replaced the two calls to getpeer_ip() and
+	getpeer_string() with one call to this function.  Streamlines the
+	peer information retrieval.
+	
+	Moved the safe_write(), safe_read(), readline(), write_message()
+	functions into a separate file: network.c
+
+	* src/reqs.c (process_request): Fixed a spelling mistake.
+	(add_xtinyproxy_header): The peer information is stored in the
+	connection, so removed the call to query it again.
+	(handle_connection): Pass the peer socket's information into the
+	connection structure for later use.
+
+	* src/grammar.y:
+	* src/scanner.l: Added the "DNSserverLocation" and
+	"DNSserverSocket" directives as they are required to properly run
+	the "dnsserver" DNS resolver.
+
+	* src/conns.c (initialize_conn): Added the peer's IP
+	dotted-decimal address and hostname to the connection structure.
+	It's faster to get the information _once_ and just store it for
+	later use.
+
+	* src/buffer.c (add_to_buffer): Changed the code to make the order
+	of insertion into the linked list explicit.  I'm not sure if this
+	fixes a bug or not, but clarity is alway nice.
+
+2002-05-13  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/buffer.h: Moved the definition of the buffer_s structure.
+	Data hiding is a good thing.  Also, replaced the BUFFER_SIZE
+	macro with a buffer_size() function.
+
+	* src/vector.c: Added the "tail" pointer to make insertions more
+	efficient.
+
+	* src/hashmap.c (hashmap_insert): Fixed a potential SEGFAULT if
+	the memory for the new hashmap entry could not be allocated.
+	(hashmap_remove): Fixed a problem where an entry could have it's
+	"prev" pointer still pointing at freed memory.  Thanks to Justin
+	Guyett for finding and fixing this problem.
+	(hashmap_insert): Thanks to Justin Guyett for changing the code to
+	use a constant time insert.  Much cleaner _and_ faster.
+
+2002-05-10  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* Makefile.am (install-data-local): Fixed up the tinyproxy.conf
+	test so that the file is only installed if it doesn't already
+	exist.
+
+2002-05-09  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	Released tinyproxy 1.5.0 (2002-05-09)
+
+2002-05-08  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* configure.ac: The --with-config option now supports absolute
+	paths.  If an absolute path is given, the full directory path and
+	file name are extracted into their appropriate parts.
+
+2002-05-07  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/reqs.c (connect_to_tunnel): Removed request logging code in
+	the tunnel method since it breaks the "tunnel" concept.
+
+2002-05-02  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* configure.ac: Added code to figure out exactly where to install
+	the configuration file.
+
+	* Makefile.am (install-data-local): Added a new install run to
+	install the configuration file to the location specified in
+	DEFAULT_CONF_FILE.
+
+2002-04-28  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/reqs.c (process_client_headers):
+	(process_server_headers): Added more error checking code and
+	send HTTP errors back to the client to let them know what is
+	happening.
+	(handle_connection): If there was a server error when processing
+	the headers, send an error back to the client.
+
+2002-04-27  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/thread.c (thread_pool_create): Set the thread's status
+	_before_ the thread is created.  Thanks to Hans-Georg Bork for
+	solving this problem.  
+	(thread_main): Fixed up the status setting code.  Removed
+	duplicated code and explicitly set the status when needed.
+
+	Fixed up all the code checking the return value from the pthread
+	functions.  These functions return 0 if OK, but a _positive_ error
+	code.
+
+2002-04-26  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/thread.c: servers_waiting needs to be signed, since it can
+	go below 0 without causing a problem, but if it wraps around all
+	hell can break loose.
+
+	* src/reqs.c (connect_to_tunnel): Changed the len type to an
+	signed integer so that we can detect error conditions.  Thanks to
+	Tom Cross for pointing out this problem.
+
+	* src/log.c (send_stored_logs): Check the return value of
+	hashmap_first() since it could be -1, indicating an empty hashmap.
+
+	* src/reqs.c (process_client_headers):
+	(process_server_headers): Test the return value of hashmap_first()
+	since the hashmap could be empty (returning a -1 via hashmap_first.)
+
+2002-04-25  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/reqs.c (remove_connection_headers): Handle both the
+	Connection header _and_ the Proxy-Connection header.
+	(free_request_struct): Check to see if request->path is actually
+	allocated before trying to delete it.
+
+	* src/hashmap.c: The hashmap will now handle multiple keys with
+	the same value.  This change was need because some sites like
+	Yahoo will send out multiple "Set-Cookie" lines.  The
+	hashmap_keys() function has been removed and has been replaced
+	with the iterator concept.  Also, a few of the functions have had
+	either their arguments changed, or their return type.  Read the
+	comments in the header file for more information.
+
+2002-04-22  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/thread.c: Renamed the LOCKing macros and added debugging
+	asserts to them.  Also, moved the mutex initialization into the
+	thread_pool_create() function since I would like to use an error
+	checking mutex, but my machine doesn't seem to work with it.  I
+	left the code there in case I can get it to work later.
+
+	* src/log.c (send_stored_logs): Added this function since the
+	log_message() function will now stored the messages if the config
+	file has not been processed yet.  This function is called from
+	within main() to output the messages to the log file _after_ it's
+	been initialized.
+
+	* src/reqs.c (process_client_headers): Added the
+	"Proxy-Connection" header to the list of client headers we don't
+	forward to the remote machine.
+
+	Added the the "Bind" directive.  This is used to indicate which IP
+	address in a multi-homed machine you would like tinyproxy to bind
+	out-going connections to.  This complements the "Listen" directive
+	for incoming connections.
+
+2002-04-18  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/sock.c (lookup_domain): Removed the call to inet_aton()
+	since the gethostbyname() will handle the dotted-decimal case
+	anyway.
+
+	* src/reqs.c: Added a new show_stats field in the conn_s structure
+	so that we will process the client's headers properly before
+	trying to send a HTTP response back.
+
+	* src/sock.c (getpeer_string): Removed the hstrerror() call since
+	it's not supported on all machines, and it's not really needed
+	anyway.
+
+	* src/vector.c:
+	* src/hashmap.c: Changed all calls to malloc, calloc, free, and
+	strdup to the appropriate safe variety.
+	(hashmap_delete): Fixed a memory leak where the maps were not
+	being freed properly.
+
+	* src/utils.c (debugging_strdup): Added this function to be used
+	by the safestrdup() macro to replace all the calls to strdup().
+	This should allow better tracking of the memory usage.
+	Also, all the debugging_* functions have had asserts added to them
+	to hopefully improve the quality of the code.
+
+	* src/reqs.c (get_all_headers): Fixed a memory leak since I was
+	not freeing the header variable, even though the hashmap makes a
+	copy of it.  Thanks to Petr Lampa for finding this one.
+
+	* src/tinyproxy.c (takesig): Moved the filter_destroy() code out
+	of the signal handler and placed it inside of main().  Same
+	reasoning as the rotate_log_files() changes below.
+
+	* src/utils.c (rotate_log_files): Moved the log rotation code out
+	of the signal handler and into it's own function.  Also improved
+	the robustness of the code.  Credit to Petr Lampa for suggesting
+	that system calls in a signal handler is bad magic.  Now the
+	signal handler sets a flag which is responded to inside of
+	thread_main_loop().
+
+2002-04-17  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* configure.ac: Added test for pthread_cancel() since it doesn't
+	seem to be available on every platform, even if the rest of
+	pthread is.  Thanks to Daniel Flemming and Petr Lampa for
+	reporting this problem.
+
+	* src/sock.c (lookup_domain): Removed the LOOKUP_LOCK() and
+	LOOKUP_UNLOCK() macros and replaced them with calls the LOCK() and
+	UNLOCK().  The reason for this change is that I can not be sure
+	that calls to gethostbyname() and gethostbyaddr() will not
+	over-write the same static block of memory.  Potential problem
+	pointed out by Petr Lampa.
+
+	* src/reqs.c (handle_connection): If the initialize_conn()
+	function fails, we need to close the socket.
+
+	* src/acl.c (check_acl): Changed the code to accept the peer IP
+	address and string address from the calling function (in this case
+	handle_connection.)
+
+	* src/thread.c (thread_main): Removed close(connfd) since it has
+	already been closed from within handle_connection(). Thanks to
+	Petr Lampa for spotting this.
+	(thread_pool_create): Added test to make sure pthread_create()
+	succeeds, and returns -1 if all the threads could not be created.
+	(thread_main_loop): Added test to determine if the
+	pthread_create() call succeeded.  Warns the admin if there was a
+	problem, but tinyproxy will continue to run.
+
+2002-04-15  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/anonymous.c (anonymous_insert): Now returns -1 upon error,
+	and 0 upon success.  This simplified the code, since I don't care
+	whether the success is from a successful insert, or because the
+	string was already present in the hashmap.
+	(anonymous_search): The function now returns a positive number
+	greater than zero if the string was found, otherwise zero or a
+	negative value is returned.  Needed to change the _one_ call to
+	this function to use the new return method.
+
+	* src/reqs.c (pull_client_data): Moved the common error exit
+	together.  Better, smaller code is produced.
+	(add_header_to_connection): Changed the code a bit to remove the
+	call to strlen() and the variable associated with it.
+	(establish_http_connection): Changed the three calls to
+	write_message() and safe_write() into one combined call to
+	write_message().
+	(send_ssl_response): Replaced the three calls to safe_write() into
+	one call to write_message().
+	(extract_http_url): Moved the common error code into it's own
+	section and jump to it upon error.
+
+2002-04-14  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/utils.c (chomp): Added an assert to detect a design error.
+
+	* src/reqs.c (read_request_line): Fixed the return type to be an
+	signed variable, so that we preserve a negative return value
+	upon an error.
+
+	* src/sock.c (readline): Added a test for allocating enough memory
+	for the whole_buffer.
+
+	* src/conns.h: Replaced the error boolean with a pointer to an
+	error string and error number for use in the
+	send_http_error_message() function.
+
+	* src/utils.c (indicate_http_error): Replaced the httperr()
+	function with this one.  Instead of sending the error right away,
+	we store the error string and number and send them _after_ the
+	client headers have been processed.
+
+2002-04-13  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/sock.c (opensock): If the Listen directive is in use, then
+	we should bind outgoing address to this address.
+	(listen_sock): Added error handling for the bind() and listen()
+	calls when setting up the listening socket.
+
+2002-04-12  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/scanner.l:
+	* src/grammar.y: Added code for the ConnectPort directive.
+
+	* src/reqs.c (add_connect_port_allowed):
+	(check_allowed_connect_ports): Added these two functions (breaking
+	by no new features rule) because they fix a security problem with
+	tinyproxy.  These functions are needed to support the ConnectPort
+	configuration directives, which allows the admin to specify which
+	ports are allowed by a CONNECT method.  This is needed to prevent
+	people from using tinyproxy to connect to mail servers (port 25)
+	to do "bad things."
+
+2002-04-11  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/reqs.c (remove_connection_headers): Moved all the code for
+	detecting and removing headers based on the Connection header into
+	this function.
+	(get_content_length): Moved the check for a Content-Length value
+	into it's own function.
+	(process_client_headers): Changed the code to use the newer
+	remove_connection_headers() and get_content_length() functions.
+	(process_server_headers): Rewrote this function to handle the
+	headers in a more consistent manner.  The connection header is
+	handled correctly, and the content-length header is stored for
+	later use.  Also, include a list of headers to not send.
+	(relay_connection): Added a test to use the
+	connptr->remote_content_length value if it's present.
+	(write_via_header): Moved the creation/modification of the Via
+	header into it's own function since it's used by both
+	process_client_headers() and process_server_headers().  I still
+	need to add code to allow you to "hide" the host information if
+	you so choose.
+
+	* src/conns.c: Added the remote_content_length variable to hold
+	the number of bytes the remove server is _supposed_ to send to
+	us.  This fixes a problem where the remote server doesn't close
+	the connection after sending the body.  Problem was reported by
+	James Flemer.
+
+2002-04-10  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/Makefile.am: Removed the dependency on LIBOBJS and instead
+	replaced it with an ADDITIONAL_OBJECTS variable defined within the
+	configure script.  This allows greater control over what is
+	compiled.
+
+	* configure.ac: Removed the AC_FUNC_LSTAT macro since it wants to
+	add lstat.o onto some machines.  I don't think the test was really
+	needed anyway, so it's better to have it gone.
+
+2002-04-09  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/anonymous.c: Changed this module to use the hashmap module
+	instead of it's own internal linked list.  Common code is good. :)
+
+	* src/reqs.c (process_client_headers): Fixed the XTINYPROXY_ENABLE
+	section to actually check if xtinyproxy has been configured.
+	(compare_headers): Removed this function since it's been replaced
+	by a call to anonymous_search().
+
+	* src/acl.c (make_netmask): James Flemer cleaned up the
+	make_netmask() function to remove the big static table.  Much
+	nicer now.
+
+	* configure.ac: The configure script now doesn't include a check
+	for the malloc.h header if tinyproxy is being compiled on an
+	OpenBSD machine.  I might actually just remove the malloc.h header
+	since the malloc/calloc/realloc/free functions are supposed to be
+	in the stdlib.h header.  I also changed the LIBOBJS="" lines to
+	AC_LIBOBJ() macro so conform to the new Autoconf rules.
+
+	* src/hashmap.c:
+	* src/vector.c: Cleaned up the include headers to _hopefully_ be
+	more portable.  Who knows though.
+
+2002-04-08  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/thread.c (thread_main_loop): Moved the looping code into
+	this function from the main() function.  Just a bit of clean up.
+	(thread_main): Changed the default cancellation point to
+	asynchronous, which means immediately.  This should fix up the
+	problem where the threads would not free correctly.
+
+2002-04-07  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/hashmap.c:
+	* src/vector.c: These two "modules" are used within the reqs.c
+	file to better handle the headers from the clients.
+
+	* src/reqs.c: Tonnes of functions changed.  The most significant
+	is the process_client_header() function which is now using the
+	hashmap functions to handle the Connection header more
+	accurately.  With the addition of the add_header_to_connection(),
+	get_all_headers(), and remove_connection_headers() function, the
+	compare_header() function is _vastly_ simplified.  Just read the
+	comments in the source itself for more information.
+
+	* src/conns.c: Cleaned up the initialize_conn and destroy_conn
+	functions to better handle error conditions.
+
+2002-04-02  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* configure.ac: Patch from James Flamer which fixes a problem with
+	the --disable-* options and also prevents -lc_r from being
+	included on FreeBSD machines.
+
+2002-01-13  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/thread.c (thread_kill_threads): Added a function to
+	explicitly go through all the active threads and kill them.
+
+2002-01-07  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/thread.c (thread_main): Added code to check if tinyproxy is
+	being killed by the user.
+
+2001-12-28  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/thread.c (thread_main): Added code to detect errors in the
+	accept() function.
+
+2001-12-23  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/utils.c (send_http_message): Use the write_message()
+	function for creating and sending the headers to the client.
+	(httperr): Use similar code to write_message() to create the body
+	of the error message. I use this so that there is no limit to the
+	size of the error message (better coding. :) I'm still trying to
+	figure out how to combine this code with write_message() into a
+	common function.
+
+	* src/sock.c (write_message): Moved write_message() into sock.c
+	since it's now accessed by more than just the reqs.c file.
+
+	* src/tinyproxy.c (main): Made the error log for the idle time
+	setting more verbose so that it's explains the reasoning
+	better. Also, changed the level to WARNING.
+
+	* src/reqs.c (process_client_headers): Cleaned up the code to send
+	the Via header by using the write_message() function.
+
+2001-12-22  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/tinyproxy.h: Add a test for the MSG_NOSIGNAL define, so it's
+	apparently a non-standard extension to send(). Also, moved the
+	<sys/resource.h> include after the includes for the various time
+	include files.
+
+2001-12-19  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/reqs.c (write_message): Encapsulate code to handle sending
+	snprintf() built lines to a file descriptor.
+	(process_server_headers): Removed duplicate code and used the
+	return value from readline() instead of recalculating it by
+	strlen().
+
+2001-12-18  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/reqs.c (connect_to_tunnel): Moved the tunnel connection code
+	into its own function.
+	(TUNNEL_CONFIGURED): Added a macro to help simplify the tests for
+	tunneling support.
+
+2001-12-17  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/reqs.c (handle_connection): Also log the request when
+	tinyproxy is in tunneling mode. This was implemented by
+	Hans-Georg Bork.
+
+2001-12-16  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/sock.c (safe_write): Add assert() calls to make sure the
+	arguments are sane.
+
+	* src/reqs.c (read_request_line): Ignore any blank lines if
+	tinyproxy is expecting a request line. This is suggested by
+	RFC2616 for a tolerant application.
+	(UPSTREAM_CONFIGURED): Added a macro to encapsulate the test for
+	upstream proxy support.
+	(establish_http_connection): Lines are now composed in a buffer
+	and then sent to the safe_write() function. This was done because
+	some sites (like www.heise.de) do not like having the request
+	line sent in pieces.
+
+2001-12-15  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/sock.c (safe_write): In addition to handling "interruption"
+	errors, continue sending the buffer until it has been fully sent
+	or a fatal error occurred.
+
+	* src/anonymous.c: Removed the calls to the ternary tree and just
+	use a basic linked list. The ternary tree might have been slightly
+	faster, but since tinyproxy is only dealing with a "few" anonymous
+	headers the ternary tree code was _way_ overkill.
+
+	* src/sock.c (lookup_domain): Removed the DNS cache since
+	according to RFC2616 a HTTP client should not cache an address if
+	the client doesn't also respect the TTL value. tinyproxy does not
+	have a complete DNS resolver. Additionally, a caching DNS system
+	is an administrator decision which should not be included in
+	tinyproxy.
+
+2001-11-25  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/buffer.c (makenewline): This function now copies the actual
+	data itself. This means any malloc() and free() functions are
+	closer together, instead of malloc()ing the data and then not
+	free()ing it.
+	(add_to_buffer): Add a new "line" to the buffer. I'm trying to
+	have more of the data go through the buffering code. Basically the
+	safe_write() function should only be called when the data needs to
+	be sent _now_.
+	(read_buffer): Fixed the code so that buffering _actually_
+	happens. :) The code will now buffer up to MAXBUFFSIZE bytes
+	(which is currently 48 KB.)
+
+2001-11-24  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* configure.ac: Changed the extension of the configure.in to match
+	the new standard for the autoconf program. Also, replaced all the
+	obsolete macros with the new standard. autoconf 2.52 is now the
+	minimum required to process this file.
+
+2001-11-23  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/sock.c (readline): Limit the maximum size of the buffer so
+	that we don't create a situation where tinyproxy could use all the
+	memory in a system. Right now we're limiting a line to a maximum
+	of 128KB.
+
+2001-11-21  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	Released tinyproxy 1.4.3 (2001-11-21)
+
+	* src/utils.c (chomp): Replaced the "trim()" function in reqs.c
+	with the new chomp() function which has similar semantics as the
+	chomp() function in Perl.
+
+	* src/sock.c (readline): Replaced the old function with a new
+	version that will allow an arbitrary long string.
+
+2001-11-03  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/buffer.c (remove_from_buffer): This function is never
+	called with an empty buffer, so removed some inaccurate code which
+	would have removed an invalid line from the buffer if it was
+	empty. What was I thinking when I wrote that? Good thing is was
+	never called.
+	(add_to_buffer): Add a bit of a sanity check to make sure the
+	buffer structure hasn't been messed up some how.
+
+2001-11-02  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/acl.c (insert_acl): Tightened the check regarding whether an
+	ACL is a string or a numeric address.
+
+2001-10-25  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* Moved all the system header included into the tinyproxy.h header
+	and changed all the other files to include it. This should
+	centralize the header dependency issue into one file.
+
+	* src/conns.c: Brought back the conns.{c,h} files which contain
+	the connection structure definition plus the creation/destruction
+	routines.
+
+	* src/reqs.c (process_client_headers): Selectively send headers
+	based on whether we're using an upstream with a CONNECT
+	request. The short answer: all methods work correctly with
+	Upstream proxying and normal proxying.
+
+	* src/tinyproxy.h: Added a upstream flag to the conn_s structure
+	so we can figure out when to send headers and when not to send
+	headers. This is extremely important when trying to do upstream
+	proxying of the CONNECT method.
+
+	* src/reqs.c (relay_connection): Empty the contents of both
+	buffers when either socket is closed. This is more in line with
+	what a tunnel should do. Since either end could close with
+	information still in the buffers.
+	(connect_to_upstream): Cleaned up the code to re-use the
+	establish_http_connection() function.
+
+	* src/buffer.c (readbuff): Changed the memory allocation to 2K
+	from 48K since an Ethernet connection is usually around 1400
+	bytes. There's little point in allocating a huge amount of memory,
+	only to shrink the memory map in the next breath.
+
+2001-10-22  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/sock.c (getpeer_string): Added logging in case the
+	gethostbyaddr() function fails.
+
+	* src/reqs.c (free_request_struct): Added a test to return if the
+	pointer is NULL.
+	(handle_connection): Cleaned up the code to better handle the
+	cause where the request is NULL.
+
+	* src/sock.c (getpeer_string):
+	* src/sock.c (getpeer_ip): When the DNS lookup fails, we need to
+	initialized the user's buffer to an empty string; otherwise, the
+	user's buffer will contain garbage and cause a SEGFAULT. Thanks to
+	Jeffrey Wheelhouse for finding this bug.
+
+2001-10-18  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/reqs.c (connect_to_upstream): Moved the code needed to
+	rebuild the request line when using the upstream feature into it's
+	own function. Simplifies the handle_connection() function.
+
+	* src/buffer.c (readbuff): Fixed a problem where a full buffer
+	would cause the connection to be closed. Thanks to Jeffrey
+	Wheelhouse for helping me find this problem.
+
+2001-09-29  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* configure.in: Uses any CFLAGS variable passed to the configure
+	script. Also, '-g -Wall' is _not_ enabled unless debugging support
+	is compiled in. Use --enable-static to compile a statically linked
+	tinyproxy.
+
+2001-09-16  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/tinyproxy.c (main): Don't allow Tunnel and Upstream
+	directives to be both set in the configuration file.
+
+	* src/reqs.c (handle_connection): Added support for an upstream
+	proxy. What we used to use for our upstream proxy has now become a
+	TCP tunnel. The difference is that the upstream proxy will do
+	domain filtering, anonymous headers, etc. while the TCP tunnel
+	just sends the data without any processing. You can not have both
+	at the same time.
+
+	* src/utils.c (send_http_message): Instead of creating a block of
+	memory with the output message, just send it to the client. We
+	still need to process the various headers from the client, but it
+	will pick up the error when it's done talking to the proxy. Uses
+	less memory.
+
+	* src/sock.c: Moved safe_write() and safe_read() into sock.c since
+	I'm using them in more than just reqs.c.
+
+2001-09-15  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* Removed all the log_message()s which reported that memory could
+	not be allocated. There's little point in reporting a memory
+	shortage since the computer will probably crash soon anyway.
+
+	* src/reqs.c (process_request): Added the code for showing the
+	stats back into the function.
+
+	* src/tinyproxy.c (takesig): When SIGHUP is received the log file
+	is rotated instead of being truncated. The rotated log has ".rot"
+	appended to the file name.
+
+2001-09-14  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/uri.c: Removed this file since it's no longer needed.
+
+	* src/reqs.c: Split the process_method() function into separate
+	smaller functions. Added support for tunnel SSL connections.
+
+	* src/tinyproxy.h: Added a field to handle SSL connections.
+
+2001-09-11  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/reqs.c (process_method): Fixed a memory leak due to the
+	change to heap allocation if there is an error.
+
+	* src/utils.c (debugging_realloc): Added the debugging version of
+	realloc().
+
+	* src/thread.c (THREAD_STACK_SIZE): Changed a threads stack size
+	to 32KB from 128KB.
+
+	* src/reqs.c (process_method):
+	* src/reqs.c (pull_client_data):
+	* src/reqs.c (process_client_headers):
+	* src/reqs.c (process_server_headers):
+	* src/buffer.c (readbuff): Using heap allocated memory for the
+	buffer rather than stack memory.
+
+	* src/uri.c (explode_uri): Fixed a potential memory leak where the
+	regular expression structure might not be freed if there was an
+	error in the expression.
+
+2001-09-08  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/ternary.c (BUFARRAY & BUFSIZE): Lowered the values to help
+	lower memory usage. A ternary tree will now max out at 4MB.
+
+	* src/utils.c: Added debugging_(malloc|calloc|free) to help track
+	down memory leaks.
+
+	* src/dnscache.c (DNS_INSERT_LIMIT): Lower the number of
+	insertions before the ternary tree is rebuilt.
+
+	* src/thread.c (thread_main): Fixed a memory leak.
+
+2001-09-07  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/thread.c (thread_pool_create): Explicitly set the detach
+	state for threads to PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED.
+
+	* Various error message clean up.
+
+	* src/thread.c (thread_main): Add locking around the
+	servers_waiting thread.
+
+2001-09-06  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/thread.c (thread_main): The code which closes a thread
+	doesn't actually work correct so I've moved the test to just after
+	a thread has handled a connection. The code still needs to be
+	cleaned up to handle locking.
+
+	* src/ternary.c (ternary_destroy): Fixed the deletion code as it
+	would cause a segfault if it was every called. Also, lowered the
+	sizes of the arrays for better memory usage.
+
+	* src/dnscache.c: After a certain number of insertions delete the
+	DNS cache and free the memory. The reason for this is that a
+	ternary tree doesn't lend itself to removing individual
+	entries. It's just easier (and cleaner) to simply delete the cache.
+
+2001-09-04  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	Released tinyproxy 1.4.2.2 (2001-09-04)
+
+	* src/reqs.c (process_client_headers): Moved the skip header test
+	in front of the compare_header() function.
+
+	* src/ternary.c (ternary_search): Switched to doing case
+	insensitive searching.
+
+	* src/log.c (log_message): Thanks to NeilK for finding and fixing
+	a problem with the syslog code which can lead to a format string
+	attack.
+
+2001-08-30  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/dnscache.c: Removed the insert_data() function and replaced
+	the "replace" logic in dns_insert() with a call to
+	ternary_replace(). This fixes the segmentation fault problem which
+	I introduced when I "tried" to fix the memory leak. Also changed
+	the LOCKing to be around the entire dnscache() again since I still
+	need to work out how locking should be done when accessing the
+	ternary tree.
+
+	* src/ternary.c (ternary_insert_replace): Renamed ternary_insert()
+	to ternary_insert_replace() and added a extra argument. The
+	function can now "replace" data already in the tree without
+	causing a memory leak. Added two DEFINES to make coding easier:
+	ternary_insert() and ternary_replace() which both call this
+	function with the right arguments.
+
+	* src/utils.c: Removed xstrstr() since it was only used in one
+	place, and could be safely replaced with strstr. I can't even
+	remember why we had this function to begin with.
+
+	* src/reqs.c (compare_header): Removed the call to xstrstr() since
+	it's been removed from the source.
+
+2001-08-29  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>

+
+2001-08-28  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	Released tinyproxy 1.4.1.5 (2001-08-28)
+
+	* src/log.c (log_message): Handle a debug enabled compile better.
+
+	* src/dnscache.c (dns_insert): Fixed a memory leak if the same
+	information was inserted into the ternary tree twice.
+
+	* configure.in: Fixed the test regarding the REGEX library. Even
+	if a working REGEX was found on the system, the included REGEX was
+	being compiled in. Double Doh.
+
+	* src/log.c (log_message): Finally got the log levels worked out
+	properly. I've tested all the levels and they now produce the
+	correct output.
+
+2001-08-27  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	Released tinyproxy 1.4.1.4 (2001-08-27)
+
+	* src/reqs.c (trim): Moved the trim functionality out of
+	process_request() and added a test to make sure we don't back the
+	pointer past the beginning of the string.
+
+	* src/log.c (log_message): Fixed a problem where the connect
+	messages were not getting through if the log level was set to
+	INFO.
+
+	* src/tinyproxy.h: Moved some of the includes around so that
+	tinyproxy can compile correctly on FreeBSD systems.
+
+	* src/thread.c: Added the pthread_attr_t structure since we're
+	going to be using a non-default sized stack because some OS's have
+	a stack size which is too small.
+
+	* configure.in: Added a test for detecting FreeBSD's -pthread
+	mechanism for telling GCC to use POSIX threading.
+
+	* src/utils.c (httperr): Fixed the MIME type. Should be be
+	text/html, not text/mime. Fix one bug, add two new ones. Sigh.
+
+2001-08-26  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	Released tinyproxy 1.4.1.3 (2001-08-26)
+	Released tinyproxy 1.4.1 (2001-08-26)
+
+	* src/utils.c (httperr): Split the headers from the actual message
+	and include more headers like Date, Server, Content-Length,
+	etc. Also set the type for the error message to const char*.
+
+	* src/reqs.c (process_method): Fixed a SEGV problem if an invalid
+	request was submitted.
+
+	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Don't include ./reconf in the
+	tarball.
+
+	* src/log.c (log_message): Fixed a problem with the new LOG_CONN
+	log level.
+
+	* configure.in: The debugging code was being included even on
+	non-debugging builds.
+
+	* src/anonymous.c (anonymous_insert): Moved the creation of the
+	search tree into the anonymous_insert() function. Therefore, the
+	search tree is _not_ created until the first insertion. This
+	should also fix a bug in main() where I was inserting headers
+	before creating the search tree. Doh.
+	(is_anonymous_enabled): Removed the tests for config.anon and
+	replaced it with a function call which returns a BOOL.
+
+	* Spell checked the ChangeLog file! :)
+
+2001-08-25  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/thread.c (thread_main): Thanks to Hans-Georg Bork for
+	fixing a problem where the status of the threads was not
+	going back to T_WAITING if MaxRequestsPerChild was 0. Also, fixed
+	a problem with the looping system where the Debian
+	start-stop-daemon script would not stop all the threads if new
+	threads had been created.
+
+	* src/log.h (LOG_CONN): Added the LOG_CONN log level. This is less
+	verbose than LOG_INFO.
+
+	* doc/tinyproxy.8: Added the -l option to the list of command line
+	options.
+
+	* src/anonymous.c (anon_insert): Fixed a bug where anonymous
+	filtering wasn't working even if it was specified in the
+	configuration file.
+
+2001-07-02  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* src/tinyproxy.c (versiondisp): Added George Talusan to the
+	copyright message. Also now include the target system name to the
+	version message.
+

+
+2001-06-04  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* configure.in: Remove the --with-* for port, logfile, and user
+	since the configuration file handles this now. Fixed a problem
+	where we were testing for the libraries correctly, but not
+	actually including them in the linking.
+
+2001-06-02  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* doc/tinyproxy.conf: Clarified the LogLevel directive.
+
+	* configure.in: Fixed up the tests for libsocket, libnsl, and
+	libresolv. Also improved the test for the yacc program since I
+	used bison 1.25 to originally write it. Updated the list of
+	headers to look for when configuring. Bumped up the version.
+
+2001-06-01  Robert James Kaes  <rjkaes@flarenet.com>
+
+	* configure.in: Fixed a problem when using the --with-port= config
+
+	* src/tinyproxy.c (main): Change the logging level from LOG_EMERG
+	(which doesn't exist anymore) to LOG_CRIT.
+
+	* src/scanner.l: Added the strings in the data structure to handle
+	the LogLevel switch.
+
+	* src/log.c (set_log_level): Code for handling selective logging.
+
+	* src/grammar.y: Added the tokens and code for handling the
+	LogLevel switch in the configuration file.
+
+	* configure.in: Added a test for the resolv library for the
+	gethostby* functions. Also bumped up the pre-version.
+

+
+2000-09-14 12:41  rjkaes
+
+	* ChangeLog, configure.in, src/tinyproxy.h: Need to do a check for

+
+2000-09-11 20:16  rjkaes
+
+	* AUTHORS, BUGS, INSTALL, README, THANKS: Just updating the
+	documentation.
+
+2000-09-11 20:12  rjkaes
+
+	* src/: grammar.c, grammar.h, grammar.y, scanner.c, scanner.l:
+	These all handle reading the tinyproxy configuration file.
+
+2000-09-11 20:10  rjkaes
+
+	* src/: ternary.c, ternary.h: Generalized the ternary code which
+	was already being used in anonymous.* now it can be used (and is
+	used) in both anonymous and dnscache
+
+2000-09-11 20:08  rjkaes
+
+	* src/: acl.c, acl.h: Improved access control semantics. Allows
+	for a finger control for allowing and denying hosts.
+
+2000-09-11 20:07  rjkaes
+
+	* src/: thread.c, thread.h: tinyproxy now uses a pool of threads to
+	handle connections. All the work for creating new threads, deleting
+	old thread, and generally managing the pool is done here.
+
+2000-09-11 20:06  rjkaes
+
+	* src/: stats.c, stats.h: This module handles the various stats
+	relating to tinyproxy's functionality.
+
+2000-09-11 20:04  rjkaes
+
+	* src/: reqs.c, reqs.h: MAJOR RE-WRITE! Read the ChangeLog and look
+	at the source. It's shorter than re-documenting the changes here. :)
+
+2000-09-11 20:03  rjkaes
+
+	* src/: tinyproxy.c, tinyproxy.h: Fixed the change user/group
+	ability.  Log when tinyproxy is using default values rather than
+	specific ones.	Cleaned up the command line arguments since
+	tinyproxy now uses a configuration file.  Removed the USR1 signal
+	and added the thread creation code.
+
+2000-09-11 20:01  rjkaes
+
+	* src/: utils.c, utils.h: Removed the xmalloc() and xstrdup()
+	functions.  Added the pidfile_create() function.  Added the OpenBSD
+	style strlcat() and strlcpy() functions.
+
+2000-09-11 19:57  rjkaes
+
+	* src/: uri.c, uri.h: Switched to the new logging style and
+	replaced the xmalloc() with straight malloc().
+
+2000-09-11 19:56  rjkaes
+
+	* src/: sock.c, sock.h: Needed locking in getpeer_string().  Added
+	mutex locking around the dnscache() call.  Removed the global
+	sockaddr and setup_fd variables.  Added the socket_blocking() and
+	socket_nonblocking() functions.  Gutted the readline() function and
+	replaced it with something similar to the 1.0 version. :)
+
+2000-09-11 19:50  rjkaes
+
+	* src/regexp.h: Moved back to the <config.h> for autoconf defines.
+
+2000-09-11 19:47  rjkaes
+
+	* src/: log.c, log.h: Cleaned up the logging format, and also
+	included logging levels (which are similar to the syslogd format.)
+
+2000-09-11 19:46  rjkaes
+
+	* src/gnuregex.c: Not using <defines.h> for autoconf anymore, so
+	move back to the <config.h> format.
+
+2000-09-11 19:43  rjkaes
+
+	* src/: filter.c, filter.h: Just using standard malloc() since the
+	xmalloc() didn't really add anything useful to the command.
+
+2000-09-11 19:42  rjkaes
+
+	* src/: dnscache.c, dnscache.h: Removed the custom hash routines.
+	Using the ternary module instead.
+
+2000-09-11 19:41  rjkaes
+
+	* src/: buffer.c, buffer.h: Cleaned up the source so that the
+	internal structure is no exposed by the buffer.h header.
+
+2000-09-11 19:38  rjkaes
+
+	* src/: anonymous.c, anonymous.h: Removed the ternary tree code
+	from these files and made it a separate module.
+
+2000-09-11 19:37  rjkaes
+
+	* src/Makefile.am: Modified to include all the files needed to
+	build tinyproxy, plus the special targets for building the LEX and
+	YACC files. (Also included the GNU license.)
+
+2000-09-11 19:33  rjkaes
+
+	* doc/tinyproxy.8: Since the tinyproxy program has changed, the
+	manual had to change as well.  Documents all the command line
+	arguments, though I think I need to document the configuration file
+	as well.
+
+2000-09-11 19:32  rjkaes
+
+	* doc/: Makefile.am, TODO: Updated to reflect the new reality of
+	the tinyproxy source code.
+
+2000-09-11 19:31  rjkaes
+
+	* doc/CONFIG: This was the layout for the purposed config file.
+	This is no more.
+
+2000-09-11 19:27  rjkaes
+
+	* INSTALL.configure: This was the generic INSTALL file, but the
+	INSTALL file itself is again the generic file. :)
+
+2000-09-11 19:24  rjkaes
+
+	* src/: config.h, conns.c, conns.h: These files are no longer used
+	within tinyproxy.
+
+2000-06-06 13:58  rjkaes
+
+	* ChangeLog: Reflect changes made in source.
+
+2000-06-06 13:56  rjkaes
+
+	* doc/tinyproxy.8: Fixed the links for finding tinyproxy. Thanks to
+	Simon Baker for pointing this out.

+without warranty of any kind.
+
+Basic Installation
+==================
+
+   Briefly, the shell commands `./configure; make; make install' should
+configure, build, and install this package.  The following
+more-detailed instructions are generic; see the `README' file for
+instructions specific to this package.  Some packages provide this
+`INSTALL' file but do not implement all of the features documented
+below.  The lack of an optional feature in a given package is not
+necessarily a bug.  More recommendations for GNU packages can be found
+in *note Makefile Conventions: (standards)Makefile Conventions.
+
+   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
+various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
+those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
+It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
+definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
+you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, and a
+file `config.log' containing compiler output (useful mainly for
+debugging `configure').
+
+   It can also use an optional file (typically called `config.cache'
+and enabled with `--cache-file=config.cache' or simply `-C') that saves
+the results of its tests to speed up reconfiguring.  Caching is
+disabled by default to prevent problems with accidental use of stale
+cache files.
+
+   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
+to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
+diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
+be considered for the next release.  If you are using the cache, and at
+some point `config.cache' contains results you don't want to keep, you
+may remove or edit it.
+
+   The file `configure.ac' (or `configure.in') is used to create
+`configure' by a program called `autoconf'.  You need `configure.ac' if
+you want to change it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version
+of `autoconf'.
+
+   The simplest way to compile this package is:
+
+  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
+     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.
+
+     Running `configure' might take a while.  While running, it prints
+     some messages telling which features it is checking for.
+
+  2. Type `make' to compile the package.
+
+  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
+     the package, generally using the just-built uninstalled binaries.
+
+  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
+     documentation.  When installing into a prefix owned by root, it is
+     recommended that the package be configured and built as a regular
+     user, and only the `make install' phase executed with root
+     privileges.
+
+  5. Optionally, type `make installcheck' to repeat any self-tests, but
+     this time using the binaries in their final installed location.
+     This target does not install anything.  Running this target as a
+     regular user, particularly if the prior `make install' required
+     root privileges, verifies that the installation completed
+     correctly.
+
+  6. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
+     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
+     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
+     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
+     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
+     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
+     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
+     with the distribution.
+
+  7. Often, you can also type `make uninstall' to remove the installed
+     files again.  In practice, not all packages have tested that
+     uninstallation works correctly, even though it is required by the
+     GNU Coding Standards.
+
+  8. Some packages, particularly those that use Automake, provide `make
+     distcheck', which can by used by developers to test that all other
+     targets like `make install' and `make uninstall' work correctly.
+     This target is generally not run by end users.
+
+Compilers and Options
+=====================
+
+   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
+the `configure' script does not know about.  Run `./configure --help'
+for details on some of the pertinent environment variables.
+
+   You can give `configure' initial values for configuration parameters
+by setting variables in the command line or in the environment.  Here
+is an example:
+
+     ./configure CC=c99 CFLAGS=-g LIBS=-lposix
+
+   *Note Defining Variables::, for more details.
+
+Compiling For Multiple Architectures
+====================================
+
+   You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
+same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
+own directory.  To do this, you can use GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
+directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
+the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
+source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.  This
+is known as a "VPATH" build.
+
+   With a non-GNU `make', it is safer to compile the package for one
+architecture at a time in the source code directory.  After you have
+installed the package for one architecture, use `make distclean' before
+reconfiguring for another architecture.
+
+   On MacOS X 10.5 and later systems, you can create libraries and
+executables that work on multiple system types--known as "fat" or
+"universal" binaries--by specifying multiple `-arch' options to the
+compiler but only a single `-arch' option to the preprocessor.  Like
+this:
+
+     ./configure CC="gcc -arch i386 -arch x86_64 -arch ppc -arch ppc64" \
+                 CXX="g++ -arch i386 -arch x86_64 -arch ppc -arch ppc64" \
+                 CPP="gcc -E" CXXCPP="g++ -E"
+
+   This is not guaranteed to produce working output in all cases, you
+may have to build one architecture at a time and combine the results
+using the `lipo' tool if you have problems.
+
+Installation Names
+==================
+
+   By default, `make install' installs the package's commands under
+`/usr/local/bin', include files under `/usr/local/include', etc.  You
+can specify an installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving
+`configure' the option `--prefix=PREFIX', where PREFIX must be an
+absolute file name.
+
+   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
+architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
+pass the option `--exec-prefix=PREFIX' to `configure', the package uses
+PREFIX as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
+Documentation and other data files still use the regular prefix.
+
+   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
+options like `--bindir=DIR' to specify different values for particular
+kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
+you can set and what kinds of files go in them.  In general, the
+default for these options is expressed in terms of `${prefix}', so that
+specifying just `--prefix' will affect all of the other directory
+specifications that were not explicitly provided.
+
+   The most portable way to affect installation locations is to pass the
+correct locations to `configure'; however, many packages provide one or
+both of the following shortcuts of passing variable assignments to the
+`make install' command line to change installation locations without
+having to reconfigure or recompile.
+
+   The first method involves providing an override variable for each
+affected directory.  For example, `make install
+prefix=/alternate/directory' will choose an alternate location for all
+directory configuration variables that were expressed in terms of
+`${prefix}'.  Any directories that were specified during `configure',
+but not in terms of `${prefix}', must each be overridden at install
+time for the entire installation to be relocated.  The approach of
+makefile variable overrides for each directory variable is required by
+the GNU Coding Standards, and ideally causes no recompilation.
+However, some platforms have known limitations with the semantics of
+shared libraries that end up requiring recompilation when using this
+method, particularly noticeable in packages that use GNU Libtool.
+
+   The second method involves providing the `DESTDIR' variable.  For
+example, `make install DESTDIR=/alternate/directory' will prepend
+`/alternate/directory' before all installation names.  The approach of
+`DESTDIR' overrides is not required by the GNU Coding Standards, and
+does not work on platforms that have drive letters.  On the other hand,
+it does better at avoiding recompilation issues, and works well even
+when some directory options were not specified in terms of `${prefix}'
+at `configure' time.
+
+Optional Features
+=================
+
+   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
+with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
+option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.
+
+   Some packages pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE' options to
+`configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
+They may also pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE
+is something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X Window System).  The
+`README' should mention any `--enable-' and `--with-' options that the
+package recognizes.
+
+   For packages that use the X Window System, `configure' can usually
+find the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,
+you can use the `configure' options `--x-includes=DIR' and
+`--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.
+
+   Some packages offer the ability to configure how verbose the
+execution of `make' will be.  For these packages, running `./configure
+--enable-silent-rules' sets the default to minimal output, which can be
+overridden with `make V=1'; while running `./configure
+--disable-silent-rules' sets the default to verbose, which can be
+overridden with `make V=0'.
+
+Particular systems
+==================
+
+   On HP-UX, the default C compiler is not ANSI C compatible.  If GNU
+CC is not installed, it is recommended to use the following options in
+order to use an ANSI C compiler:
+
+     ./configure CC="cc -Ae -D_XOPEN_SOURCE=500"
+
+and if that doesn't work, install pre-built binaries of GCC for HP-UX.
+
+   On OSF/1 a.k.a. Tru64, some versions of the default C compiler cannot
+parse its `<wchar.h>' header file.  The option `-nodtk' can be used as
+a workaround.  If GNU CC is not installed, it is therefore recommended
+to try
+
+     ./configure CC="cc"
+
+and if that doesn't work, try
+
+     ./configure CC="cc -nodtk"
+
+   On Solaris, don't put `/usr/ucb' early in your `PATH'.  This
+directory contains several dysfunctional programs; working variants of
+these programs are available in `/usr/bin'.  So, if you need `/usr/ucb'
+in your `PATH', put it _after_ `/usr/bin'.
+
+   On Haiku, software installed for all users goes in `/boot/common',
+not `/usr/local'.  It is recommended to use the following options:
+
+     ./configure --prefix=/boot/common
+
+Specifying the System Type
+==========================
+
+   There may be some features `configure' cannot figure out
+automatically, but needs to determine by the type of machine the package
+will run on.  Usually, assuming the package is built to be run on the
+_same_ architectures, `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints
+a message saying it cannot guess the machine type, give it the
+`--build=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
+type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name which has the form:
+
+     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM
+
+where SYSTEM can have one of these forms:
+
+     OS
+     KERNEL-OS
+
+   See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If
+`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't
+need to know the machine type.
+
+   If you are _building_ compiler tools for cross-compiling, you should
+use the option `--target=TYPE' to select the type of system they will
+produce code for.
+
+   If you want to _use_ a cross compiler, that generates code for a
+platform different from the build platform, you should specify the
+"host" platform (i.e., that on which the generated programs will
+eventually be run) with `--host=TYPE'.
+
+Sharing Defaults
+================
+
+   If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share,
+you can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives
+default values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
+`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
+`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
+`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
+A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.
+
+Defining Variables
+==================
+
+   Variables not defined in a site shell script can be set in the
+environment passed to `configure'.  However, some packages may run
+configure again during the build, and the customized values of these
+variables may be lost.  In order to avoid this problem, you should set
+them in the `configure' command line, using `VAR=value'.  For example:
+
+     ./configure CC=/usr/local2/bin/gcc
+
+causes the specified `gcc' to be used as the C compiler (unless it is
+overridden in the site shell script).
+
+Unfortunately, this technique does not work for `CONFIG_SHELL' due to
+an Autoconf bug.  Until the bug is fixed you can use this workaround:
+
+     CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash /bin/bash ./configure CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash
+
+`configure' Invocation
+======================
+
+   `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
+operates.
+
+`--help'
+`-h'
+     Print a summary of all of the options to `configure', and exit.
+
+`--help=short'
+`--help=recursive'
+     Print a summary of the options unique to this package's
+     `configure', and exit.  The `short' variant lists options used
+     only in the top level, while the `recursive' variant lists options
+     also present in any nested packages.
+
+`--version'
+`-V'
+     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
+     script, and exit.
+
+`--cache-file=FILE'
+     Enable the cache: use and save the results of the tests in FILE,
+     traditionally `config.cache'.  FILE defaults to `/dev/null' to
+     disable caching.
+
+`--config-cache'
+`-C'
+     Alias for `--cache-file=config.cache'.
+
+`--quiet'
+`--silent'
+`-q'
+     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To
+     suppress all normal output, redirect it to `/dev/null' (any error
+     messages will still be shown).
+
+`--srcdir=DIR'
+     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
+     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.
+
+`--prefix=DIR'
+     Use DIR as the installation prefix.  *note Installation Names::
+     for more details, including other options available for fine-tuning
+     the installation locations.
+
+`--no-create'
+`-n'
+     Run the configure checks, but stop before creating any output
+     files.
+
+`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.  Run
+`configure --help' for more details.

+Tinyproxy
+=========
+
+Tinyproxy is a small, efficient HTTP/SSL proxy daemon released under the
+GNU General Public License.  Tinyproxy is very useful in a small network
+setting, where a larger proxy would either be too resource intensive, or
+a security risk.  One of the key features of Tinyproxy is the buffering
+connection concept.  In effect, Tinyproxy will buffer a high speed
+response from a server, and then relay it to a client at the highest
+speed the client will accept.  This feature greatly reduces the problems
+with sluggishness on the Internet.  If you are sharing an Internet
+connection with a small network, and you only want to allow HTTP
+requests to be allowed, then Tinyproxy is a great tool for the network
+administrator.
+
+For more info, please visit:
+
+	https://www.banu.com/tinyproxy/
+
+
+Installation
+------------
+
+To install this package under a UNIX derivative, read the INSTALL file.
+Tinyproxy uses a standard GNU `configure` script. Basically you should
+be able to do:
+
+----
+./configure
+make
+make install
+----
+
+in the top level directory to compile and install Tinyproxy. There are
+additional command line arguments you can supply to `configure`. They
+include:
+
+	--enable-debug		If you would like to turn on full
+				debugging support
+	--enable-xtinyproxy	Compile in support for the XTinyproxy
+				header, which is sent to any web
+				server in your domain.
+	--enable-filter		Allows Tinyproxy to filter out certain
+				domains and URLs.
+	--enable-upstream	Enable support for proxying connections
+				through another proxy server.
+	--enable-transparent-proxy
+				Allow Tinyproxy to be used as a
+				transparent proxy daemon
+	--enable-static		Compile a static version of Tinyproxy
+
+        --with-stathost=HOST	Set the default name of the stats host
+
+
+Support

+
+Contributing
+------------
+
+If you would like to contribute a feature, or a bug fix to the Tinyproxy
+source, please send a patch (preferably as a unified diff. i.e. `diff
+-u` against the "master" branch of the Tinyproxy source code git
+repository to tinyproxy-developers-list.  Please include a description
+of what your patch does.
+
+Tinyproxy's git repository is git://www.banu.com/tinyproxy.git. The
+following command creates a local copy:
+
+----
+git clone git://www.banu.com/tinyproxy.git
+----
+
+The easiest and preferred way to create a patch for submission is to
+check in your changes locally and use `git format-patch` to generate a
+mbox-style commit file that contains the diff along with the commit
+message and author information.  Such a format-patch file can be
+integrated into the upstream repository, automatically keeping the
+commit message and author information.
+
+You can also meet developers and discuss development issues and patches
+in the #tinyproxy IRC channel on Freenode (irc.freenode.net).

+TODO List
+---------
+
+The following are features that I would like to add to tinyproxy in the
+future.  Where possible, I've listed the person who suggested it.  This
+list is in no particular order.  And hey, if you want to implement one of
+these, or another idea you have, go right ahead.  Just mail me the diff
+against the current tree and I'll integrate it if possible.
+
+    [ Actually, the ordering has become kind of important as of
+      late. Basically, I'm adding new ideas to the bottom of the list
+      as I go. ]
+
+ * Include hooks so other types of proxies can be modularly added to
+   the source tree.  Then people can simply choose which types of
+   proxies (ftp, www, etc) they'd like enabled in tinyproxy.h
+   Suggested: Tarun Tuli.
+
+ * Include a function to rewrite the incoming requests.  Should not be
+   much of a problem.  Just need to modify the process_method() code
+   to look up the URL and rewrite it.  If we want to go really fancy
+   with RegEx mapping this could get ugly. :)
+
+ * Have the ability to send the data from the connections through an
+   external filtering program.  I kind of like this idea, but I don't
+   really have a good way of doing it yet.
+   Suggested: Ed Avis
+
+ * Include the ability to rewrite both incoming and outgoing headers.
+
+ * Enable an option for chroot() jailing tinyproxy.
+
+ * Come up with a more consistent (and elegant) way of logging errors
+   for the administrators.  Right now it's more a hodge-podge
+   collections of error messages without a _real_ standard.  I would
+   prefer a more uniform look.
+
+ * Include user authentication for accessing tinyproxy itself.
+   Administrators should be allowed to selectively allow certain users
+   access to tinyproxy via a user name/password pair.  Check the
+   HTTP/1.1 RFC for more information.  [Suggested: Tyrone Tranmer]
+
+   ==> https://www.banu.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=13
+
+ * Remove common.h and fix order of headers
+
+ * Remove memory debugging functions (Valgrind is good enough)
+
+ * Make all functions return from one place (the end of the function)
+
+ * Move TODO items to Banu Bugzilla

+# For projects using AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR([foo]), Autoconf sets
+# $ac_aux_dir to `$srcdir/foo'.  In other projects, it is set to
+# `$srcdir', `$srcdir/..', or `$srcdir/../..'.
+#
+# Of course, Automake must honor this variable whenever it calls a
+# tool from the auxiliary directory.  The problem is that $srcdir (and
+# therefore $ac_aux_dir as well) can be either absolute or relative,
+# depending on how configure is run.  This is pretty annoying, since
+# it makes $ac_aux_dir quite unusable in subdirectories: in the top
+# source directory, any form will work fine, but in subdirectories a
+# relative path needs to be adjusted first.
+#
+# $ac_aux_dir/missing
+#    fails when called from a subdirectory if $ac_aux_dir is relative
+# $top_srcdir/$ac_aux_dir/missing
+#    fails if $ac_aux_dir is absolute,
+#    fails when called from a subdirectory in a VPATH build with
+#          a relative $ac_aux_dir
+#
+# The reason of the latter failure is that $top_srcdir and $ac_aux_dir
+# are both prefixed by $srcdir.  In an in-source build this is usually
+# harmless because $srcdir is `.', but things will broke when you
+# start a VPATH build or use an absolute $srcdir.
+#
+# So we could use something similar to $top_srcdir/$ac_aux_dir/missing,
+# iff we strip the leading $srcdir from $ac_aux_dir.  That would be:
+#   am_aux_dir='\$(top_srcdir)/'`expr "$ac_aux_dir" : "$srcdir//*\(.*\)"`
+# and then we would define $MISSING as
+#   MISSING="\${SHELL} $am_aux_dir/missing"
+# This will work as long as MISSING is not called from configure, because
+# unfortunately $(top_srcdir) has no meaning in configure.
+# However there are other variables, like CC, which are often used in
+# configure, and could therefore not use this "fixed" $ac_aux_dir.
+#
+# Another solution, used here, is to always expand $ac_aux_dir to an
+# absolute PATH.  The drawback is that using absolute paths prevent a

+\`configure' configures Tinyproxy 1.8.2 to adapt to many kinds of systems.
+
+Usage: $0 [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...
+
+To assign environment variables (e.g., CC, CFLAGS...), specify them as
+VAR=VALUE.  See below for descriptions of some of the useful variables.
+
+Defaults for the options are specified in brackets.
+
+Configuration:
+  -h, --help              display this help and exit
+      --help=short        display options specific to this package
+      --help=recursive    display the short help of all the included packages
+  -V, --version           display version information and exit
+  -q, --quiet, --silent   do not print \`checking...' messages
+      --cache-file=FILE   cache test results in FILE [disabled]
+  -C, --config-cache      alias for \`--cache-file=config.cache'
+  -n, --no-create         do not create output files
+      --srcdir=DIR        find the sources in DIR [configure dir or \`..']
+
+Installation directories:
+  --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
+                          [$ac_default_prefix]
+  --exec-prefix=EPREFIX   install architecture-dependent files in EPREFIX
+                          [PREFIX]
+
+By default, \`make install' will install all the files in
+\`$ac_default_prefix/bin', \`$ac_default_prefix/lib' etc.  You can specify
+an installation prefix other than \`$ac_default_prefix' using \`--prefix',
+for instance \`--prefix=\$HOME'.
+
+For better control, use the options below.
+
+Fine tuning of the installation directories:
+  --bindir=DIR            user executables [EPREFIX/bin]
+  --sbindir=DIR           system admin executables [EPREFIX/sbin]

+  --libdir=DIR            object code libraries [EPREFIX/lib]
+  --includedir=DIR        C header files [PREFIX/include]
+  --oldincludedir=DIR     C header files for non-gcc [/usr/include]

+
+Some influential environment variables:
+  CC          C compiler command
+  CFLAGS      C compiler flags
+  LDFLAGS     linker flags, e.g. -L<lib dir> if you have libraries in a
+              nonstandard directory <lib dir>
+  LIBS        libraries to pass to the linker, e.g. -l<library>
+  CPPFLAGS    (Objective) C/C++ preprocessor flags, e.g. -I<include dir> if
+              you have headers in a nonstandard directory <include dir>
+  CPP         C preprocessor
+
+Use these variables to override the choices made by `configure' or to help
+it to find libraries and programs with nonstandard names/locations.

+Using tinyproxy with Your Home/Small Business Network
+
+Written: Patrick L. McGillan
+Edited:  Robert James Kaes (2002-06-04)
+-----------------------------------------------------
+
+Being as this will be the most common usage and there were no clear
+basic instructions for this scenario, I thought I would write up what
+I did for my home system.
+
+First the layout of the network.  A cable modem is connected through a
+Linksys Router to a small hub.  The computers hanging off the hub and
+have a clear shot to the Internet.
+
+So, the connection from the Internet to the hub looks like this:
+
+   Internet->Cable TV Line->Cable Modem->Linksys Router->Hub/Switch
+
+Restricting Internet web access on some of those computers (connected
+to the hub) is what using tinyproxy is all about.  Using the web
+interface to the Linksys router, turn off all Internet access to those
+computers that shouldn't have direct access to the Internet.  This is
+done by clicking on the advanced tab and entering the IP number in the
+filter range.  Now those computers have to go through a proxy, for
+their access, as they have no direct access.
+
+On one of the Linux computers which still has Internet access (I use
+an old 486) load up tinyproxy.  Now have the users configure their
+Internet Explorer/Netscape Navigator programs to use the proxy on the
+tinyproxy computer box, along with the port number declared in the
+tinyproxy configuration file.  By default, there is no blocking of web
+sites with this program, so I created a file, called "filter", to
+start blocking some sites.
+
+Example "filter" file entries:
+
+bannerads.zwire.com
+ad.doubleclick.net
+ads.fortunecity.com
+
+This filter file usually goes into the same folder, as your
+configuration file.  Be sure and uncomment the 'Filter' line in your
+configuration file and make sure it points at your newly created
+filter file.
+

+INFO
+----
+The following files were/are useful for the proper coding of
+tinyproxy. Please note: someday tinyproxy will actually be RFC
+compliant, but today is not that day. Right now tinyproxy is pretty
+close to being HTTP/1.0 compliant, but there are probably a few
+incompatibilities kicking around.
+
+RFCs
+----
+1945	Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.0
+2396	Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax
+2616	Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1
+2617	HTTP Authentication: Basic and Digest Access Authentication
+
+POSSIBLE LOCATION
+-----------------
+There are many places to obtain a copy of the RFCs, but I use
+
+      http://www.rfc-editor.org/
+
+since it provides a great search feature for finding all the RFCs for
+a particular topic.

+
+tinyproxy.conf - Tinyproxy HTTP proxy daemon configuration file
+
+
+SYNOPSIS
+--------
+
+*tinyproxy.conf*
+
+
+DESCRIPTION
+-----------
+
+`tinyproxy(8)` reads its configuration file, typically stored in
+`/etc/tinyproxy/tinyproxy.conf` (or passed to Tinyproxy with -c on the
+command line). This manpage describes the syntax and contents of the
+configuration file.
+
+The Tinyproxy configuration file contains key-value pairs, one per
+line. Lines starting with `#` and empty lines are comments and are
+ignored. Keywords are case-insensitive, whereas values are
+case-sensitive. Values may be enclosed in double-quotes (") if they
+contain spaces.
+
+The possible keywords and their descriptions are as follows:
+
+*User*::
+
+    The user which the Tinyproxy process should run as, after the
+    initial port-binding has been done as the `root` user. Either the
+    user name or the UID may be specified.
+
+*Group*::
+
+    The group which the Tinyproxy process should run as, after the
+    initial port-binding has been done as the `root` user. Either the
+    group name or the GID may be specified.
+
+*Port*::
+
+    The port which the Tinyproxy service will listen on. If the port is
+    less than 1024, you will need to start the Tinyproxy process as the
+    `root` user.
+
+*Listen*::
+
+    By default, Tinyproxy listens for connections on all available
+    interfaces (i.e. it listens on the wildcard address `0.0.0.0`).
+    With this configuration parameter, Tinyproxy can be told to listen
+    only on one specific address.
+
+*Bind*::
+
+    This allows you to specify which address Tinyproxy will bind
+    to for outgoing connections to web servers or upstream proxies.
+
+*BindSame*::
+
+    If this boolean parameter is set to `yes`, then Tinyproxy will
+    bind the outgoing connection to the IP address of the incoming
+    connection that triggered the outgoing request.
+
+*Timeout*::
+
+    The maximum number of seconds of inactivity a connection is
+    allowed to have before it is closed by Tinyproxy.
+
+*ErrorFile*::
+
+    This parameter controls which HTML file Tinyproxy returns when a
+    given HTTP error occurs. It takes two arguments, the error number
+    and the location of the HTML error file.
+
+*DefaultErrorFile*::
+
+    This parameter controls the HTML template file returned when an
+    error occurs for which no specific error file has been set.
+
+*StatHost*::
+
+    This configures the host name or IP address that is treated
+    as the `stat host`: Whenever a request for this host is received,
+    Tinyproxy will return an internal statistics page instead of
+    forwarding the request to that host. The template for this
+    page can be configured with the `StatFile` configuration option.
+    The default value of `StatHost` is `@TINYPROXY_STATHOST@`.
+
+*StatFile*::
+
+    This configures the HTML file that Tinyproxy sends when
+    a request for the stathost is received. If this parameter is
+    not set, Tinyproxy returns a hard-coded basic statistics page.
+    See the STATHOST section in the `tinyproxy(8)` manual page
+    for details.
+    +
+    Note that the StatFile and the error files configured with ErrorFile
+    and DefaultErrorFile are template files that can contain a few
+    template variables that Tinyproxy expands prior to delivery.
+    Examples are "\{cause}" for an abbreviated error description and
+    "\{detail}" for a detailed error message.  The `tinyproxy(8)`
+    manual page contains a description of all template variables.
+
+*LogFile*::
+
+    This controls the location of the file to which Tinyproxy
+    writes its debug output. Alternatively, Tinyproxy can log
+    to syslog -- see the Syslog option.
+
+*Syslog*::
+
+    When set to `On`, this option tells Tinyproxy to write its
+    debug messages to syslog instead of to a log file configured
+    with `LogFile`. These two options are mutually exclusive.
+
+*LogLevel*::
+
+    Sets the log level. Messages from the set level and above are
+    logged. For example, if the LogLevel was set to Warning, then all
+    log messages from Warning to Critical would be output, but Notice
+    and below would be suppressed. Allowed values are:
+
+    * Critical (least verbose)
+    * Error
+    * Warning
+    * Notice
+    * Connect (log connections without Info's noise)
+    * Info (most verbose)
+
+*PidFile*::
+
+    This option controls the location of the file where the main
+    Tinyproxy process stores its process ID for signaling purposes.
+
+*XTinyproxy*::
+
+    Setting this option to `Yes` tells Tinyproxy to add a header
+    `X-Tinyproxy` containing the client's IP address to the request.
+
+*Upstream*::
+*No Upstream*::
+
+    This option allows you to set up a set of rules for deciding
+    whether an upstream proxy server is to be used, based on the
+    host or domain of the site being accessed. The rules are stored
+    in the order encountered in the configuration file and the
+    LAST matching rule wins. There are three possible forms for
+    specifying upstream rules:
+
+    * 'upstream host:port' turns proxy upstream support on generally.
+
+    * 'upstream host:port "site_spec"' turns on the upstream proxy for
+    the sites matching `site_spec`.
+
+    * 'no upstream "site_spec"' turns off upstream support for sites
+    matching `site_spec`.
+
+    The site can be specified in various forms as a hostname, domain
+    name or as an IP range:
+
+    * 'name'     matches host exactly
+    * '.name'    matches any host in domain "name"
+    * '.'        matches any host with no domain (in 'empty' domain)
+    * 'IP/bits'  matches network/mask
+    * 'IP/mask'  matches network/mask
+
+*MaxClients*::
+
+    Tinyproxy creates one child process for each connected client.
+    This options specifies the absolute highest number processes that
+    will be created. With other words, only MaxClients clients can be
+    connected to Tinyproxy simultaneously.
+
+*MinSpareServers*::
+*MaxSpareServers*::
+
+    Tinyproxy always keeps a certain number of idle child processes
+    so that it can handle new incoming client requests quickly.
+    `MinSpareServer` and `MaxSpareServers` control the lower and upper
+    limits for the number of spare processes. I.e. when the number of
+    spare servers drops below `MinSpareServers` then Tinyproxy will
+    start forking new spare processes in the background and when the
+    number of spare processes exceeds `MaxSpareServers` then Tinyproxy
+    will kill off extra processes.
+
+*StartServers*::
+
+    The number of servers to start initially. This should usually be
+    set to a value between MinSpareServers and MaxSpareServers.
+
+*MaxRequestsPerChild*::
+
+    This limits the number of connections that a child process
+    will handle before it is killed. The default value is `0`
+    which disables this feature.  This option is meant as an
+    emergency measure in the case of problems with memory leakage.
+    In that case, setting `MaxRequestsPerChild` to a value of e.g.
+    1000, or 10000 can be useful.
+
+*Allow*::
+*Deny*::
+
+    The `Allow` and `Deny` options provide a means to customize
+    which clients are allowed to access Tinyproxy. `Allow` and `Deny`
+    lines can be specified multiple times to build the access control
+    list for Tinyproxy. The order in the config file is important.
+    If there are no `Allow` or `Deny` lines, then all clients are
+    allowed. Otherwise, the default action is to deny access.
+    The argument to `Allow` or `Deny` can be a single IP address
+    of a client host, like `127.0.0.1`, an IP address range, like
+    `192.168.0.1/24` or a string that will be matched against the
+    end of the client host name, i.e, this can be a full host name
+    like `host.example.com` or a domain name like `.example.com` or
+    even a top level domain name like `.com`.
+
+*AddHeader*::
+
+    Configure one or more HTTP request headers to be added to outgoing
+    HTTP requests that Tinyproxy makes. Note that this option will not
+    work for HTTPS traffic, as Tinyproxy has no control over what
+    headers are exchanged.
+    +
+----
+AddHeader "X-My-Header" "Powered by Tinyproxy"
+----
+
+*ViaProxyName*::
+
+    RFC 2616 requires proxies to add a `Via` header to the HTTP
+    requests, but using the real host name can be a security
+    concern. If the `ViaProxyname` option is present, then its
+    string value will be used as the host name in the Via header.
+    Otherwise, the server's host name will be used.
+
+*DisableViaHeader*::
+
+    When this is set to yes, Tinyproxy does NOT add the `Via` header
+    to the requests. This virtually puts Tinyproxy into stealth mode.
+    Note that RFC 2616 requires proxies to set the `Via` header, so by
+    enabling this option, you break compliance.
+    Don't disable the `Via` header unless you know what you are doing...
+
+*Filter*::
+
+    Tinyproxy supports filtering of web sites based on URLs or
+    domains. This option specifies the location of the file
+    containing the filter rules, one rule per line.
+
+*FilterURLs*::
+
+    If this boolean option is set to `Yes` or `On`, filtering is
+    performed for URLs rather than for domains. The default is to
+    filter based on domains.
+
+*FilterExtended*::
+
+    If this boolean option is set to `Yes`, then extended POSIX
+    regular expressions are used for matching the filter rules.
+    The default is to use basic POSIX regular expressions.
+
+*FilterCaseSensitive*::
+
+    If this boolean option is set to `Yes`, then the filter rules
+    are matched in a case sensitive manner. The default is to
+    match case-insensitively.
+
+*FilterDefaultDeny*::
+
+    The default filtering policy is to allow everything that is
+    not matched by a filtering rule. Setting `FilterDefaultDeny`
+    to `Yes` changes the policy do deny everything but the domains
+    or URLs matched by the filtering rules.
+
+*Anonymous*::
+
+    If an `Anonymous` keyword is present, then anonymous proxying
+    is enabled.  The headers listed with `Anonymous` are allowed
+    through, while all others are denied. If no Anonymous keyword
+    is present, then all headers are allowed through.  You must
+    include quotes around the headers.
+    +
+    Most sites require cookies to be enabled for them to work correctly, so
+    you will need to allow cookies through if you access those sites.
+    +
+    Example:
+    +
+----
+Anonymous "Host"
+Anonymous "Authorization"
+Anonymous "Cookie"
+----
+
+*ConnectPort*::
+
+    This option can be used to specify the ports allowed for the
+    CONNECT method. If no `ConnectPort` line is found, then all
+    ports are allowed. To disable CONNECT altogether, include a
+    single ConnectPort line with a value of `0`.
+
+*ReversePath*::
+
+    Configure one or more ReversePath directives to enable reverse proxy
+    support. With reverse proxying it's possible to make a number of
+    sites appear as if they were part of a single site.
+    +
+    If you uncomment the following two directives and run Tinyproxy
+    on your own computer at port 8888, you can access example.com,
+    using http://localhost:8888/example/.
+    +
+----
+ReversePath "/example/" "http://www.example.com/"
+----
+
+*ReverseOnly*::
+
+    When using Tinyproxy as a reverse proxy, it is STRONGLY
+    recommended that the normal proxy is turned off by setting
+    this boolean option to `Yes`.
+
+*ReverseMagic*::
+
+    Setting this option to `Yes`, makes Tinyproxy use a cookie to
+    track reverse proxy mappings. If you need to reverse proxy
+    sites which have absolute links you must use this option.
+
+*ReverseBaseURL*::
+
+    The URL that is used to access this reverse proxy. The URL is
+    used to rewrite HTTP redirects so that they won't escape the
+    proxy. If you have a chain of reverse proxies, you'll need to
+    put the outermost URL here (the address which the end user
+    types into his/her browser).  If this option is not set then
+    no rewriting of redirects occurs.

+NAME
+----
+
+tinyproxy - A light-weight HTTP proxy daemon
+
+
+SYNOPSIS
+--------
+
+*tinyproxy* [-vldch]
+
+
+DESCRIPTION
+-----------
+
+*tinyproxy* is a light-weight HTTP proxy daemon designed to consume a
+minimum amount of system resources. It listens on a given TCP port and
+handles HTTP proxy requests. Designed from the ground up to be fast and
+yet small, it is an ideal solution for use cases such as embedded
+deployments where a full featured HTTP proxy is required, but the system
+resources for a larger proxy are unavailable.
+
+
+OPTIONS
+-------
+
+*tinyproxy* accepts the following options:
+
+*-c <config-file>*::
+    Use an alternate configuration file.
+
+*-d*::
+    Don't daemonize and stay in the foreground. Useful for debugging purposes.
+
+*-h*::
+    Display a short help screen of command line arguments and exit.
+
+*-l*::
+    Display the licensing agreement.
+
+*-v*::
+    Display version information and exit.
+
+
+SIGNALS
+-------
+
+In addition to command-line options, there are also several signals that
+can be sent to *tinyproxy* while it is running to generate debugging
+information and to force certain events.
+
+*SIGHUP*::
+    Force Tinyproxy to do a garbage collection on the current
+    connections linked list. This is usually done automatically after a
+    certain number of connections have been handled.
+
+
+TEMPLATE FILES
+--------------
+
+There are two occasions when Tinyproxy delivers HTML pages to
+the client on it's own right:
+
+. When an error occurred, a corresponding error page is returned.
+. When a request for the stathost is made, a page summarizing the
+  connection statistics is returned. (See STATHOST below.)
+
+The layout of both error pages and the statistics page can be
+controlled via configurable HTML template files that are plain
+HTML files that additionally understand a few template
+variables.
+
+
+TEMPLATE VARIABLES
+------------------
+
+There are several standard HTML variables that are available in every
+template file:
+
+*request*::
+    The full HTTP request line.
+
+*cause*::
+    The abbreviated cause of the error condition.
+
+*clientip*::
+    The IP address of the client making the request.
+
+*clienthost*::
+    The hostname of the client making the request.
+
+*version*::
+    The version of Tinyproxy.
+
+*package*::
+    The package name. Presently, resolves to 'tinyproxy'.
+
+*date*::
+    The current date/time in HTTP format.
+
+In addition, almost all templates support:
+
+*detail*::
+    A detailed, plain English explanation of the error and possible
+    causes.
+
+When Tinyproxy finds a variable name enclosed in braces, e.g.
+"\{request}", then this is replaced by the value of the corresponding
+variable before delivery of the page.
+
+
+STATHOST
+--------
+
+Tinyproxy returns a HTML page with connection statistics when it
+receives a HTTP request for a certain host -- the stathost.  The
+stathost name defaults to `@TINYPROXY_STATHOST@` and can be changed at
+runtime to any name or IP address with the configuration variable
+`StatHost`.
+
+The stat file template can be changed at runtime through the
+configuration variable `StatFile`.

+## tinyproxy.conf -- tinyproxy daemon configuration file
+##
+## This example tinyproxy.conf file contains example settings
+## with explanations in comments. For decriptions of all
+## parameters, see the tinproxy.conf(5) manual page.
+##
+
+#
+# User/Group: This allows you to set the user and group that will be
+# used for tinyproxy after the initial binding to the port has been done
+# as the root user. Either the user or group name or the UID or GID
+# number may be used.
+#
+User nobody
+Group nobody
+
+#
+# Port: Specify the port which tinyproxy will listen on.  Please note
+# that should you choose to run on a port lower than 1024 you will need
+# to start tinyproxy using root.
+#
+Port 8888
+
+#
+# Listen: If you have multiple interfaces this allows you to bind to
+# only one. If this is commented out, tinyproxy will bind to all
+# interfaces present.
+#
+#Listen 192.168.0.1
+
+#
+# Bind: This allows you to specify which interface will be used for
+# outgoing connections.  This is useful for multi-home'd machines where
+# you want all traffic to appear outgoing from one particular interface.
+#
+#Bind 192.168.0.1
+
+#
+# BindSame: If enabled, tinyproxy will bind the outgoing connection to the
+# ip address of the incoming connection.
+#
+#BindSame yes
+
+#
+# Timeout: The maximum number of seconds of inactivity a connection is
+# allowed to have before it is closed by tinyproxy.
+#
+Timeout 600
+
+#
+# ErrorFile: Defines the HTML file to send when a given HTTP error
+# occurs.  You will probably need to customize the location to your
+# particular install.  The usual locations to check are:
+#   /usr/local/share/tinyproxy
+#   /usr/share/tinyproxy
+#   /etc/tinyproxy
+#
+#ErrorFile 404 "@pkgdatadir@/404.html"
+#ErrorFile 400 "@pkgdatadir@/400.html"
+#ErrorFile 503 "@pkgdatadir@/503.html"
+#ErrorFile 403 "@pkgdatadir@/403.html"
+#ErrorFile 408 "@pkgdatadir@/408.html"
+
+#
+# DefaultErrorFile: The HTML file that gets sent if there is no
+# HTML file defined with an ErrorFile keyword for the HTTP error
+# that has occured.
+#
+DefaultErrorFile "@pkgdatadir@/default.html"
+
+#
+# StatHost: This configures the host name or IP address that is treated
+# as the stat host: Whenever a request for this host is received,
+# Tinyproxy will return an internal statistics page instead of
+# forwarding the request to that host.  The default value of StatHost is
+# @TINYPROXY_STATHOST@.
+#
+#StatHost "@TINYPROXY_STATHOST@"
+#
+
+#
+# StatFile: The HTML file that gets sent when a request is made
+# for the stathost.  If this file doesn't exist a basic page is
+# hardcoded in tinyproxy.
+#
+StatFile "@pkgdatadir@/stats.html"
+
+#
+# LogFile: Allows you to specify the location where information should
+# be logged to.  If you would prefer to log to syslog, then disable this
+# and enable the Syslog directive.  These directives are mutually
+# exclusive.
+#
+#LogFile "@localstatedir@/log/tinyproxy/tinyproxy.log"
+
+#
+# Syslog: Tell tinyproxy to use syslog instead of a logfile.  This
+# option must not be enabled if the Logfile directive is being used.
+# These two directives are mutually exclusive.
+#
+#Syslog On
+
+#
+# LogLevel: 
+#
+# Set the logging level. Allowed settings are:
+#	Critical	(least verbose)
+#	Error
+#	Warning
+#	Notice
+#	Connect		(to log connections without Info's noise)
+#	Info		(most verbose)
+#
+# The LogLevel logs from the set level and above. For example, if the
+# LogLevel was set to Warning, then all log messages from Warning to
+# Critical would be output, but Notice and below would be suppressed.
+#
+LogLevel Info
+
+#
+# PidFile: Write the PID of the main tinyproxy thread to this file so it
+# can be used for signalling purposes.
+#
+#PidFile "@localstatedir@/run/tinyproxy/tinyproxy.pid"
+
+#
+# XTinyproxy: Tell Tinyproxy to include the X-Tinyproxy header, which
+# contains the client's IP address.
+#
+#XTinyproxy Yes
+
+#
+# Upstream:
+#
+# Turns on upstream proxy support.
+#
+# The upstream rules allow you to selectively route upstream connections
+# based on the host/domain of the site being accessed.
+#
+# For example:
+#  # connection to test domain goes through testproxy
+#  upstream testproxy:8008 ".test.domain.invalid"
+#  upstream testproxy:8008 ".our_testbed.example.com"
+#  upstream testproxy:8008 "192.168.128.0/255.255.254.0"
+#
+#  # no upstream proxy for internal websites and unqualified hosts
+#  no upstream ".internal.example.com"
+#  no upstream "www.example.com"
+#  no upstream "10.0.0.0/8"
+#  no upstream "192.168.0.0/255.255.254.0"
+#  no upstream "."
+#
+#  # connection to these boxes go through their DMZ firewalls
+#  upstream cust1_firewall:8008 "testbed_for_cust1"
+#  upstream cust2_firewall:8008 "testbed_for_cust2"
+#
+#  # default upstream is internet firewall
+#  upstream firewall.internal.example.com:80
+#
+# The LAST matching rule wins the route decision.  As you can see, you
+# can use a host, or a domain:
+#  name     matches host exactly
+#  .name    matches any host in domain "name"
+#  .        matches any host with no domain (in 'empty' domain)
+#  IP/bits  matches network/mask
+#  IP/mask  matches network/mask
+#
+#Upstream some.remote.proxy:port
+
+#
+# MaxClients: This is the absolute highest number of threads which will
+# be created. In other words, only MaxClients number of clients can be
+# connected at the same time.
+#
+MaxClients 100
+
+#
+# MinSpareServers/MaxSpareServers: These settings set the upper and
+# lower limit for the number of spare servers which should be available.
+#
+# If the number of spare servers falls below MinSpareServers then new
+# server processes will be spawned.  If the number of servers exceeds
+# MaxSpareServers then the extras will be killed off.
+#
+MinSpareServers 5
+MaxSpareServers 20
+
+#
+# StartServers: The number of servers to start initially.
+#
+StartServers 10
+
+#
+# MaxRequestsPerChild: The number of connections a thread will handle
+# before it is killed. In practise this should be set to 0, which
+# disables thread reaping. If you do notice problems with memory
+# leakage, then set this to something like 10000.
+#
+MaxRequestsPerChild 0
+
+#
+# Allow: Customization of authorization controls. If there are any
+# access control keywords then the default action is to DENY. Otherwise,
+# the default action is ALLOW.
+#
+# The order of the controls are important. All incoming connections are
+# tested against the controls based on order.
+#
+Allow 127.0.0.1
+
+#
+# AddHeader: Adds the specified headers to outgoing HTTP requests that
+# Tinyproxy makes. Note that this option will not work for HTTPS
+# traffic, as Tinyproxy has no control over what headers are exchanged.
+#
+#AddHeader "X-My-Header" "Powered by Tinyproxy"
+
+#
+# ViaProxyName: The "Via" header is required by the HTTP RFC, but using
+# the real host name is a security concern.  If the following directive
+# is enabled, the string supplied will be used as the host name in the
+# Via header; otherwise, the server's host name will be used.
+#
+ViaProxyName "tinyproxy"
+
+#
+# DisableViaHeader: When this is set to yes, Tinyproxy does NOT add
+# the Via header to the requests. This virtually puts Tinyproxy into
+# stealth mode. Note that RFC 2616 requires proxies to set the Via
+# header, so by enabling this option, you break compliance.
+# Don't disable the Via header unless you know what you are doing...
+#
+#DisableViaHeader Yes
+
+#
+# Filter: This allows you to specify the location of the filter file.
+#
+#Filter "@sysconfdir@/filter"
+
+#
+# FilterURLs: Filter based on URLs rather than domains.
+#
+#FilterURLs On
+
+#
+# FilterExtended: Use POSIX Extended regular expressions rather than
+# basic.
+#
+#FilterExtended On
+
+#
+# FilterCaseSensitive: Use case sensitive regular expressions.
+#
+#FilterCaseSensitive On
+
+#
+# FilterDefaultDeny: Change the default policy of the filtering system.
+# If this directive is commented out, or is set to "No" then the default
+# policy is to allow everything which is not specifically denied by the
+# filter file.
+#
+# However, by setting this directive to "Yes" the default policy becomes
+# to deny everything which is _not_ specifically allowed by the filter
+# file.
+#
+#FilterDefaultDeny Yes
+
+#
+# Anonymous: If an Anonymous keyword is present, then anonymous proxying
+# is enabled.  The headers listed are allowed through, while all others
+# are denied. If no Anonymous keyword is present, then all headers are
+# allowed through.  You must include quotes around the headers.
+#
+# Most sites require cookies to be enabled for them to work correctly, so
+# you will need to allow Cookies through if you access those sites.
+#
+#Anonymous "Host"
+#Anonymous "Authorization"
+#Anonymous "Cookie"
+
+#
+# ConnectPort: This is a list of ports allowed by tinyproxy when the
+# CONNECT method is used.  To disable the CONNECT method altogether, set
+# the value to 0.  If no ConnectPort line is found, all ports are
+# allowed (which is not very secure.)
+#
+# The following two ports are used by SSL.
+#
+ConnectPort 443
+ConnectPort 563
+
+#
+# Configure one or more ReversePath directives to enable reverse proxy
+# support. With reverse proxying it's possible to make a number of
+# sites appear as if they were part of a single site.
+#
+# If you uncomment the following two directives and run tinyproxy
+# on your own computer at port 8888, you can access Google using
+# http://localhost:8888/google/ and Wired News using
+# http://localhost:8888/wired/news/. Neither will actually work
+# until you uncomment ReverseMagic as they use absolute linking.
+#
+#ReversePath "/google/"	"http://www.google.com/"
+#ReversePath "/wired/"	"http://www.wired.com/"
+
+#
+# When using tinyproxy as a reverse proxy, it is STRONGLY recommended
+# that the normal proxy is turned off by uncommenting the next directive.
+#
+#ReverseOnly Yes
+
+#
+# Use a cookie to track reverse proxy mappings. If you need to reverse
+# proxy sites which have absolute links you must uncomment this.
+#
+#ReverseMagic Yes
+
+#
+# The URL that's used to access this reverse proxy. The URL is used to
+# rewrite HTTP redirects so that they won't escape the proxy. If you
+# have a chain of reverse proxies, you'll need to put the outermost
+# URL here (the address which the end user types into his/her browser).
+#
+# If not set then no rewriting occurs.
+#
+#ReverseBaseURL "http://localhost:8888/"

+dnl We cannot use the AC_CHECK_TYPE macros becasue AC_CHECK_TYPE
+dnl #includes only <sys/types.h>, <stdlib.h>, and <stddef.h>.
+dnl Unfortunately, many implementations today hide typedefs in wierd
+dnl locations: Solaris 2.5.1 has uint8_t and uint32_t in <pthread.h>.
+dnl SunOS 4.1.x has int8_t in <sys/bittypes.h>.
+dnl So we define our own macro AC_UNP_CHECK_TYPE that does the same
+dnl #includes as "unp.h", and then looks for the typedef.
+dnl
+dnl This macro should be invoked after all the header checks have been
+dnl performed, since we #include "confdefs.h" below, and then use the
+dnl HAVE_foo_H values that is can #define.

+ * ----------------
+ * The idea behind this application programming interface (API) is to
+ * represent an HTTP response message as a concrete entity.  The API
+ * functions allow the message to be built up systematically before
+ * transmission to a connected socket.
+ *
+ * The order of the functions in your program would look something like
+ * this:
+ *   http_message_create()
+ *   http_message_set_response()
+ *   http_message_set_body() [optional if no body is required]
+ *   http_message_add_headers() [optional if no additional headers are used]
+ *   http_message_send()
+ *   http_message_destroy()
+ *
+ * NOTE: No user data is stored in the http_message_t type; therefore,
+ * do not delete strings referenced by the http_message_t object
+ * before you call http_message_destroy().  By not copying data, the
+ * API functions are faster, but you must take greater care.
+ *
+ * (Side note: be _very_ careful when using stack allocated memory with
+ * this API.  Bad things will happen if you try to pass the
+ * http_message_t out of the calling function since the stack
+ * allocated memory referenced by the http_message_t will no long
+ * exist.)

+ * Okay, I have modelled the levels for logging off the syslog() interface.
+ * However, I would really prefer if only five of the levels are used. You
+ * can see them below and I'll describe what each level should be for.
+ * Hopefully tinyproxy will remain consistent with these levels.
+ *	-- rjkaes
+ * Sorry but I had to destroy the hope ;-) There was a need to log
+ * connections without the INFO stuff and not to have them as NOTICE.
+ *	-- hgb
+ *
+ * Level	Description
+ * -----	-----------
+ * LOG_CRIT	This is catastrophic. Basically, tinyproxy can not recover
+ *		from this and will either close the child (if we're lucky),
+ *		or the entire daemon. I would relegate this to conditions
+ *		like unable to create the listening socket, or unable to
+ *		create a child. If you're going to log at this level provide
+ *		as much information as possible.
+ *
+ * LOG_ERR	Okay, something bad happened. We can recover from this, but
+ *		the connection will be terminated. This should be for things
+ *		like when we cannot create a socket, or out of memory.
+ *		Basically, the connection will not work, but it's not enough
+ *		to bring the whole daemon down.
+ *
+ * LOG_WARNING	There is condition which will change the behaviour of
+ *		tinyproxy from what is expected. For example, somebody did
+ *		not specify a port. tinyproxy will handle this (by using
+ *		it's default port), but it's a _higher_ level situation
+ *		which the admin should be aware of.
+ *
+ * LOG_NOTICE	This is for a special condition. Nothing has gone wrong, but
+ *		it is more important than the common LOG_INFO level. Right
+ *		now it is used for actions like creating/destroying children,
+ *		unauthorized access, signal handling, etc.
+ *
+ * LOG_CONN	This additional level is for logging connections only, so
+ *		it is easy to control only the requests in the logfile.
+ *		If we log through syslog, this is set to LOG_INFO.
+ *			-- hgb
+ *
+ * LOG_INFO	Everything else ends up here. Logging for incoming
+ *		connections, denying due to filtering rules, unable to
+ *		connect to remote server, etc.
+ *
+ * LOG_DEBUG	Don't use this level. :) Use the two DEBUG?() macros
+ *		instead since they can remain in the source if needed. (I
+ *		don't advocate this, but it could be useful at times.)
